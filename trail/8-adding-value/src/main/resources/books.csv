"Fire and Ink: An Anthology of Social Action Writing","Frances Payne Adler","9780816527939","Fire and Ink is a powerful and impassioned anthology of stories, poems, interviews, and essays that confront some of the most pressing social issues of our day. Designed to inspire and inform, this collection embodies the concepts of ""breaking silence,"" ""bearing witness,"" resistance, and resilience. Beyond students and teachers, the book will appeal to all readers with a commitment to social justice. Fire and Ink brings together, for the first time in one volume, politically engaged writing by poets, fiction writers, and essayists. Including many of our finest writers Martín Espada, June Jordan, Patricia Smith, Gloria Anzaldúa, Sharon Olds, Arundhati Roy, Sonia Sanchez, Carolyn Forche, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, Alice Walker, Linda Hogan, Gary Soto, Kim Blaeser, Minnie Bruce Pratt, Li-Young Lee, and Jimmy Santiago Baca, among others this is an indispensable collection.  This groundbreaking anthology marks the emergence of social action writing as a distinct field within creative writing and literature. Featuring never-before-published pieces, as well as reprinted material, Fire and Ink is divided into ten sections focused on significant social issues, including identity, sexuality and gender, the environment, social justice, work, war, and peace. The pieces can often be gripping, such as ""Frame,"" in which Adrienne Rich confronts government and police brutality, or Chris Abani's ""Ode to Joy,"" which documents great courage in the face of mortal danger.  Fire and Ink serves as a wonderful reader for a wide range of courses, from composition and rhetoric classes to courses in ethnic studies, gender studies, American studies, and even political science, by facing apast that was often accompanied by injustice and suffering. But beyond that, this collection teaches us that we all have the power to create a more equitable and just future. Publishers WeeklyWhile the editors of this generous anthology of fiction and nonfiction describe social action rather dryly as “a form of critical inquiry and an act of social responsibility,” the passionate pieces making up the collection elevate it into a meditation on the sanctity and wonder of each life. It's that overarching sensitivity that gives these diverse creative voices their moral and political force—and is echoed in the Buddhist “mindfulness” practiced by Vietnamese monk and social worker Chân Không, or the “small things” that make sense of the greatest transformations for novelist-activist Arundhati Roy, or the alertness to “the trauma of being different” in editor García's own migrant labor camp recollections. It comes as a refreshing antidote to the obfuscating abstractions clustered around the most pressing issues of the time—including those that become thematic categories in the anthology, such as war, the environment and labor. The general quality of writing, among both better and lesser known writers of conscience, ensures the collection is as timeless as it is timely. (Oct.)","2009","9"
"Drinking, Smoking and Screwing: Great Writers on Good Times","Sara Nickles","9780811807845","Before the notion of ""political correctness"" encroached on the ways people spoke, wrote, and conducted themselves in public and private, some of America's best writers embraced unsafe sex, excessive alcohol, and a good cigar. From the classically libidinous Henry Miller to the hilariously contemporary Fran Lebowitz, Drinking, Smoking and Screwing includes novel excerpts, essays, poems, and short stories in a bawdy and thoroughly entertaining anthology with no warnings -- and no apologies.Library JournalThis collection of 24 poems, essays, short stories, and excerpts from novels written between 1917 and 1986 has been put together to show readers that there was a time when Americans enjoyed drinking, smoking, and screwing rather than worrying, as do many writers in the 1990s, about how these activities threaten their health. However, though many selections are amusing, most stress the problems and frustrations that result from these activities rather than the joy. Authors include Dorothy Parker, Erica Jong, Mary McCarthy, Vladimir Nabokov, J.P. Donleavy, and Henry Miller, and most of what is collected here is well known. Nothing in the organization of the material or in the introduction provides insight into either familiar or unfamiliar writings. Not recommended.-Judy Mimken, Boise, Id.","1994","8"
"White Lines: Writers on Cocaine","Geno Zanetti","9781560253785","Blow, candy, Charlie, coke, go, ice, rock, snow, crack. Whatever you call it, thrill seekers have surrendered to cocaine’s siren call, paid their toll, and sold their souls. Its embrace can be deadly, a place of no return, the ultimate rush, public enemy number one. From the gutter to the penthouse, inner city to outer burb, from the Third World coca farmer to the executive addict, coke is the lifeblood of a global black economy and an outlaw underground. Coke has also been dark muse, torment, and theme to many of our greatest writers. White Lines gathers these literary thrill seekers in a classic and contemporary snort through the fog- and fear-filled streets of Victorian London to the dance macabre of the post-Vietnam culture of the 1970s, from the couch of Dr. Freud and the bacchanal of Mr. Magus, Aleister Crowley, to the narcotic thrill of fin de siecle casino capitalism, White Lines takes you into illicit and artificial worlds, near wild heavens and then deep, down underground. Selections from writers like Irvine Welsh, Bret Easton Ellis, William S. Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, Kim Wozencraft, Terry Southern, Sigmund Freud, Arthur Conan Doyle, Peter Biskind, and Julia Phillips are featured.Kirkus ReviewsEnglish editor Zanetti, who collected celebrations of the ultimate outlaw vehicle in She's a Bad Motorcycle (2002), teams up with his filmmaking partner Hyde to present essays about another accessory of the rebel lifestyle. Two entries from Richard Rudgely's Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances set up the reader with some basic facts: ""the cultural story of coca,"" a plant that has played a respected role in Andean culture for thousands of years, ""was radically different from that of the crass glitzy beginnings and subsequently sordid short life of its extract cocaine."" First isolated in 1860, cocaine enjoyed a few decades of positive press. It was imbibed by Queen Victoria, carried by the first man to fly across the English Channel, and used in Coca-Cola. Sigmund Freud's article "" ber Coca"" displays the generally favorable attitude typical of those years, relating the doctor's personal experiences and outlining cocaine's uses in treating disorders ranging from digestive problems to alcohol and morphine addiction. From there we move through some less enthusiastic texts, including Arthur Conan Doyle's account of Sherlock Holmes craving the drug's stimulation from ""The Sign of the Four"" and Aleister Crowley's story of drug-fueled debauchery in Paris (""Au Pays de Cocaine""). Then the editors let the veil drop completely. William Burroughs gets creepy with ""Coke Bugs,"" Charles Nicholls recounts a drug deal gone decidedly wrong in ""A Night with Captain Cocaine,"" and in an excerpt from his autobiography, Miles Davis recalls being so paranoid when coked up that he regularly looked for people hiding under the radiator. Hollywood is also well represented, with desperate accounts by Julia Phillipsand Carrie Fisher, among others; bad boys Brett Easton Ellis and Jay McInerney turn up as a matter of course; and Stephen King provides the single breath of air in the oppressive atmosphere with a three-page account of how he kicked his addiction. Evidence that cocaine has provided a lot of good writers with some very ugly experiences.","2002","9"
"Queer 13: Lesbian and Gay Writers Recall Seventh Grade","Clifford Chase","9780688171612","Gym class, group showers, zits, band practice, drama club, birth of pubic hair, pranks, secrets, spin-the-bottle, voice changes, bullies, sissies, friendship, enemyship -- what's not to love about turning 13? For a gay child, it may be traumatic, but it also carries a richness of observed detail of small but important moments, turning points of sorts. Adolescence is a watermark for pain and change; the anthology Queer 13 contains 25 remembrances of the era of sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, charged with the sparks that only the very young can give off.Hank Stuever""When casting about for survival tales of the seventh grade, Clifford Chase, who edited this book of essays, found that most gay writers had suppressed it, like time they'd spent in a cultural junior-high version of Dachau: utter oppression, grueling days, anxious and terrifying nights. They'd simply blocked it out. Seventh grade wasn't too fun for anyone, but it seems to be a particular watershed event for these wordy gays and lesbians, who have risen to the assignment and reconjured that particular year with pubescent horror: the longing, the armpit hair, the confusion, the shame, the teasing -- it's all here. Thankfully, as the sage Judy Blume always assured us, it's only seventh grade, and most everyone survives it. Even gay kids. Seen from these 25 collected pieces -- many of them quite clever memoirs; some of them merely more overwrought gunk from the para-memoirist craze -- seventh grade is quite a hurdle, but also a magic place.""","1999","7"

Only Savannah's literary monuments can give voice to the rich and diverse history of one of America's greatest and most visited cities.

"Pamphlets of Protest: An Anthology of Early African American Protest Literature, 1790-1860","Richard G. Newman","9780415924443","Between the Revolution and the Civil War, African-American writing became a prominent feature of both black protest culture and American public life. Although denied a political voice in national affairs, black authors produced a wide range of literature to project their views into the public sphere. Autobiographies and personal narratives told of slavery's horrors, newspapers railed against racism in its various forms, and poetry, novellas, reprinted sermons and speeches told tales of racial uplift and redemption.The editors examine the important and previously overlooked pamphleteering tradition and offer new insights into how and why the printed word became so important to black activists during this critical period. An introduction by the editors situates the pamphlets in their various social, economic and political contexts. This is the first book to capture the depth of black print culture before the Civil War by examining perhaps its most important form, the pamphlet.","2000","4"
"If I Had My Life to Live Over","Sandra Martz","9780918949257","This companion volume to the award-winning anthology, When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple, illuminates the experiences of women, young and old, reflecting on the choices they have made. In these stories and poems we see how women's alternatives are both extended and limited by personal belief systems, ethnic and cultural identity, class and economic status, age, and gender. Whether exploring significant public events or small private choices, these word portraits resonate with authenticity and meaning.Publishers WeeklyLacking the eccentricity and distinctiveness of its bestselling predecessor, When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple (on women and aging), also edited by Martz, this new volume on the theme of the choices women make throughout their lives is simplistic at best. The language of most stories and poems here is uninventive and often cliched; themes are staid. ``A child is growing somewhere / in this weary world, / an innocent unwary / of emotions shattered,'' writes Shirley Vogler Meister in a sing-song, rhyming poem about adoption; and the narrator of Stephany Brown's story, whose boyfriend promptly enlisted in the Army when at 16 she told him she was pregnant, says that ``having his baby is still the best thing I ever did.'' Too many of these pieces have haunting echoes of a campaign for Family Values. Reading these pages, one would assume women no longer make choices other than having children vs. having an abortion, marriage vs. divorce, or which boy to date. A few excellent tidbits--Janice Levy's story about a Mexican woman entering the U.S. illegally and working as a maid or Pat Schneider's poem about a sister choosing to be a nun--are not enough to make this volume worth reading. 70,000 first printing.

Several of the stories, set in the 1970s, appeared in Killian's previous collections, such as “Hot Lights,” in which a strapped-for-cash student gets hired for a hardcore porn shoot, and “Spurt,” set in a Long Island motel where a couple of commuters congregate to indulge in morbid sex. Others are elaborate romances, such as “Dietmar Lutz Mon Amour,” where an erotic encounter with a security guard in the basement of San Francisco's De Young museum provides a fulfilling intellectual kinship for the married narrator, and “Too Far,” in which a straight swimming pool salesman from Maryland clearly wants to experiment with a man at a party, though he may get more than he anticipates. Killian is best being self-consciously writerly, as in “Rochester,” in which a naïve writer arrives at the dilapidated home of the legendary writer “Kevin Killian,” only to discover a decrepit has-been who keeps a pet chimpanzee typing in the bedroom.

Bruce Franklin","9780140273052","This unique collection dramatizes the history of the modern American prison and offers a harrowing vision of prison life in America today. H. Bruce Franklin, a leading authority on American prison writing, has gathered more than sixty selections from some of the most powerful works - memoirs, stories, novels, poemswritten in the last hundred years.Publishers WeeklyHarrowing in their frank detail and desperate tone, the more than 60 selections in this anthology of writings about the prison experience in America pack an emotional wallop. According to Wicker's outspoken foreword, ""prisons and the violence and despair they symbolize... are a blot on American life and history."" The U.S. penal system contains a population greater than that of New Hampshire, and even the pretense of rehabilitation was long ago subsumed by the need to punish. Beginning with accounts of the victims of Jim Crow and Black Code laws in the segregationist South and going through the contemporary journalism of Dannie Martin and Mumia Abu-Jamal, these views from behind the bars should be required reading for anyone concerned about the violence in our society and the high rate of recidivism. Franklin, in his introduction, argues that the institution of slavery has its modern counterpart in penal servitude While he sometimes seems stuck in the clichs of a New Left rhetoric, he has done a fine job of rediscovering the prison writers of the 1920s (a period of real flowering among convict writers, supported by H.L. Mencken's American Mercury magazine) like Jim Tully, Chester Himes and Ernie Booth. In this context, the more famous works of writers such as Nelson Algren, Malcolm X and Jack Henry Abbot, gain a fuller resonance. The book also highlights writers, like Piri Thomas, who are alive today but neglected. If the test of an anthology is whether it makes the reader want to pursue the works of the authors it presents, this provocative volume definitely qualifies. (June)","1998","1"

"The American Stage: Writing on Theater from Washington Irving to Tony Kushner","Lawrence Senelick","9781598530698","Here is the story, told firsthand through electric, deeply engaged writing, of America's living theater, high and low, mainstream and experimental. Drawing on history, criticism, memoir, fiction, poetry, and parody, editor Laurence Senelick presents writers with the special knack ""to distill both the immediate experience and the recollected impression, to draw the reader into the charmed circle and conjure up what has already vanished."" Through the words of playwrights and critics, actors and directors, and others behind the footlights, the entertainments and high artistic strivings of successive eras come vividly, sometimes tumultuously, to life. Observers from Washington Irving and Fanny Trollope to Walt Whitman and Mark Twain evoke the world of the nineteenth-century playhouse in all its raucous vitality. Henry James confesses his early enthusiasm for playgoing; Willa Cather reviews provincial productions of Uncle Tom's Cabin and Antony and Cleopatra. The increasing diversity and ambition of the American theater is reflected in Hutchins Hapgood's account of New York's Yiddish theaters at the turn of the century, Carl Van Vechten's review of the Sicilian actress Mimi Aguglia, Alain Locke's comments on the emerging African-American theater in the 1920s, and Ezra Pound's response to James Joyce's play Exiles and theatrical modernism. Enthusiasts for the New Stagecraft, such as Lee Simonson and Djuna Barnes, are matched by champions of pop culture such as Gilbert Seldes and Fred Allen. S. J. Perelman lampoons Clifford Odets; Edmund Wilson acclaims Minsky's Burlesque; Harold Clurman explains Stanislavski's Method; Gore Vidal dissects the compromises of commercial playwriting. A host of playwrightsamong them Thornton Wilder, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Lorraine Hansberry, Edward Albee, Wendy Wasserstein, David Mamet, and Tony Kushnerare joined by such renowned critics as Stark Young, George Jean Nathan, Brooks Atkinson, and Eric Bentley.","2010","9"

"I Am Not My Breast Cancer: Women Talk Openly about Love and Sex, Hair Loss and Weight Gain, Mothers and Daughters, and Being a Woman with Breast Cancer","Ruth Peltason","9780061174070","""I am not my breast, and I am not cancer; they are only pieces of who I am. What is my heart like, am I kind, strong, loving, compassionate. . . . Those are the things that count."" I Am Not My Breast Cancer gathers the warm, loving, frank, and informed voices of more than 800 women-from every state in the nation and from continents as far away as Australia and Africa-who reveal their fears, trade advice, share experiences, and express their deepest, most intimate concerns. Nothing before this groundbreaking book has captured the real experience of breast cancer. It is essential reading for any woman with this diagnosis. I Am Not My Breast Cancer offers women the companionship of other women dealing with this disease. Ruth Peltason, who has twice undergone treatment for breast cancer, has woven their stories together while maintaining the authenticity of their voices. These are ordinary women dealing with this cancer and its many ramifications. They range in age from their early twenties to their late seventies. They are the collective face of breast cancer today. Their comments are moving, sometimes funny, always honest. They speak out on every topic, from lovemaking and intimacy to losing their hair, from juggling the day-to-day realities of being a patient, mother, wife, and coworker to the overwhelming worries about their own mortality. Remarkably, they emerge with grace and optimism and a determination not to be defined by disease. Taking the reader chronologically through the stages of diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and self-discovery, I Am Not My Breast Cancer offers women a deeper understanding of themselves and living with cancer. As Peltason writes inher introduction, ""My greatest wish for this book is that it offer comfort to any woman living with breast cancer and to those who care about her. If this book is kept on the bedside table, then I hope its need is brief and its impact lasting. I Am Not My Breast Cancer speaks of courage, heroism in deeds small and large, and incredible faith and fortitude."" ""You can live without a breast. You cannot say the same for the human heart.""Publishers WeeklyPeltason, an editor and breast cancer survivor, founded and hosted the ""First Person Plural"" Web site project, an online forum for women facing the disease. Their dialogue provides the content for this book, culled from the entries of 800 women across the U.S. and around the world. Peltason organizes the material into three general parts: ""Diagnosis,"" ""Living with Breast Cancer"" and ""The Big Picture,"" with such subtopics as ""Sharing the News,"" ""Being Womanly"" and ""Anniversaries and Milestones."" Participants use screen names for privacy, approaching their disease with candor and freely discussing their feelings about their bodies and their relationships. At times, those overcome by anger and fear far outweigh those with a bright outlook, but when these survivors ""look in the mirror"" at the conclusion of the text, many envision a hopeful future. Perhaps the most poignant entries are from younger women, some of whom have been driven into early menopause and infertility by chemotherapy. Although this is an informative book, some survivors may discover that these raw entries churn up disturbing emotions; others will find comfort in these voices, and in the knowledge that they aren't alone-either in their sorrow or in their strength and courage.

"New Playwrights: The Best Plays of 2008","Lawrence Harbison","9781575256184","No one I think can disagree that the theatrical season 2007-2008 was one of the strongest in terms of new plays in recent memory. Amazingly, more than a handful escaped the critics' clutches, though some fine new plays deserved better than the drubbing they received. One thinks of Theresa Rebeck's Mauritius, Stephen Adly Guirgis's The Little Flower of East Orange, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's Good Boys and True-though none of these excellent plays would have made this book, as none are by new playwrights. Of the plays included herein, only one was produced outside New York. Usually, I try to include at least three plays produced by regional theaters. This year I read several, but I just couldn't get as worked up about them as I did the plays I selected. It was also a good year for comedy, lately generally unwelcome on our stages unless it's dark, satiric, and cynical. It is hard for me, usually, to find comedies worthy of inclusion in my new playwrights book. Not this year!The Butcher of Baraboo, Election Day, and Spain are comedies. The first two plays were produced by Second Stage as part of their summer series. The Butcher of Baraboo is about a small-town woman whose husband has disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and the town gossips suspect that she done it. Election Day is about a local mayoral election and examines with amusing dexterity why we vote the way we do. Spain was produced Off Broadway by MCC at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. It's about a young woman who believes that there's a sixteenth-century Spanish conquistador in her living room. Harvest is a touching drama about a farmer who refuses to give up his farm, even ashe is going under. He manages to hold onto his farm but not his wife, who didn't bargain for a life of poverty and struggle. Neighborhood 3: Requisition of Doom is a drama about a group of teenagers in a suburban neighborhood obsessed with an online video game set in their community, who come to believe that they are being invaded by aliens from outer space-who look suspiciously like their parents. It was produced to acclaim by Actors Theatre of Louisville at their 2008 Humana Festival and subsequently at the 2008 Summer Play Festival in New York. 100 Saints You Should Know comes to us from Playwrights Horizons and is about a single mom looking for something to believe in and a Catholic priest who has decided to leave the church as he has lost his faith. Unconditional was produced by LAByrinth Theater Company at The Public Theater. Of its three disparate stories, the central one is about a human resources worker who becomes enraged when he is laid off after many years on the job and just a short while from retirement and the pension he was counting on.All these plays represent the best of American playwriting. I hope you like them as much as I do, but more important, I hope you produce them!-Lawrence HarbisonBrooklyn, New York","2009","4"

"Word Virus","William S. Burroughs","9780802136947","With the publication of Naked Lunch in 1959, William Burroughs abruptly brought international letters into the postmodern age. Beginning with his very early writing (including a chapter from his and Jack Kerouac's never-before-seen collaborative novel), Word Virus follows the arc of Burroughs's remarkable career, from his darkly hilarious ""routines"" to the experimental cut-up novels to Cities of the Red Night and The Cat Inside. Beautifully edited and complemented by James Grauerholz's illuminating biographical essays, Word Virus charts Burroughs's major themes and places the work in the context of the life. It is an excellent tool for the scholar and a delight for the general reader. Throughout a career that spanned half of the twentieth century, William S.

"Anthology of Modern American Poetry","Cary Nelson","9780195122718","Anthology of Modern American Poetry contains more than 750 poems by 161 American poets, including many who have not been anthologized before. Spanning a period from Walt Whitman to Sherman Alexie, this collection is the first to review the twentieth century comprehensively. It presents not only the canonical poetry of the last hundred years but also numerous poems by women, minority, and progressive writers only rediscovered in the past two decades. Uniquely comprehensive, Anthology of Modern American Poetry represents Robert Frost with 23 poems, Wallace Stevens with 22, and Marianne Moore with 14, including her most ambitious long poems.

Many works benefit from specially commissioned research that provides students with such help as the identification of the inventive references in Melvin Tolson's poetry, translation of all foreign language passages, and illumination of obscure references.

"The Portable Beat Reader","Various","9780142437537","Through poetry, fiction, essays, song lyrics, letters, and memoirs, this authoritative single-volume collection of Beat literature captures the triumphant energy of a movement that swept through American letters with hurricane force. Featuring: Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Gary Snyder, Neal Cassady, Gregory Corso, Diane Di Prima, Bob Dylan, Ken Kesey, Charles Bukowski, Michael McClure, and more.Publishers WeeklyCutting through bohemian posturing and excess, Charters here reprints much of the most vital, readable and relevant material produced by the Beat generation, primarily in the 1950s and '60s, with some selections from the '70s and '80s. The novels of such leading figures as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs lend themselves well to excerpting, giving this volume creditable ballast. Representative works of Allen Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gary Snyder are included along with those of lesser-known Beats (e.g., John Clellon Holmes), fellow travelers like Frank O'Hara and Amiri Baraka, and wives and girlfriends often overlooked at the time, including Hettie Jones, Carolyn Cassady and Joyce Johnson. Charters ( Kerouac ) offers a broad perspective on this seminal literary movement: she links East Coast Beats to the San Francisco Renaissance poets; pays attention to such latter-day Beats as Ed Sanders and Tuli Kupferberg; and explains the position of non-Beat but related writers--Alan Watts, Anne Waldman, Diane DiPrima and the young Norman Mailer--in her helpful introductory essay and notes preceeding each entry. Her energizing, liberating anthology makes it clear that such Beat preoccupations as the bomb, the meaninglessness of modern existence and ecological destruction remain current. ( Jan. )","2003","5"

Suite of interrelated short comedies about the unforgettable denizens of a tiny town in Maine. A hit Off-Broadway at the Daryl Roth Theatre. War in Paramus Barbara Dana.

Off-Broadway success about several American and African woman dealing with the reality of AIDS In their lives. Originally produced off-Broadway at Primary Stages, then transferred for a successful commercial run Off-Broadway and has toured all over the world. Six Years Sharr White. Compelling drama from the Humana Festival that follows the lives of a husband and wife from just after the Second World War up into the Vietnam era.Larry Schwartz - Library JournalReading a new play is not as exciting as seeing the first production, but there's still a frisson when the cover is turned-and the added benefit that frustration does not require leaving at intermission but just hurling the book aside. Alas, the latest collection of plays from the Humana Festival met the floor several times. Except for Eric Coble's Natural Selection, Adam Bock's Three Guys and a Brenda, and Sharr White's Six Years(also included in New Playwrights), the works are disappointing. Natural Selection, set at a time when the world outdoors is viewed with fear and suspicion, is funny and off balance-a sort of sequel to Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth. Three Guysbends gender like a damp willow branch (a theme also taken up with some subtlety by Jordan Harrison's Act a Lady). Six Yearstracks the integration, disintegration, and reintegration (maybe) of the marriage of Phil and Meredith. It's deeply disturbing, tragic, and moving and would make for a very satisfying night at the theater.Lepidus brings forth the ninth volume of Smith &amp; Kraus's ""Best Plays"" series, and it's mighty fine. The seven works are all full-length plays, and every one of them deserves production-from university theater to community theater to professional companies. The common theme among these works seems to be outsiders seeking love. Michael Golamco's Cowboy Versus Samurai, about three (and the only) Asians in a Wyoming town, speaks at operatic intensity to the ""only"" out there, wherever they are. And then there's John Cariani's Almost, Maine, a wonderful play made up of four actors, 19 roles, 11 interconnectedscenes, a rural setting, love in the air, and shooting stars. If your library has the run of the series to which these volumes belong, there's no reason not to get the latest issue. New Playwrightsis strongly recommended for academic and public libraries; Humana Festival 2006would be better appreciated by theater departments in an academic setting.","2007","9"

Though none of the playwrights in this collection are household names yet, or close to it, all of them write the kind of vivid, well-crafted work that deserves attention.

There is no doubt that we’re living in a freer America as a result of the Beat literary movement, which is an important part of the larger picture of cultural and political change in this country during the last forty years, when a four-letter word couldn’t appear on the printed page and minority rights were ridiculous.” Anne Waldman, a renowned poet and longtime friend of many of these writers, has gathered in this volume a range of the best and most exemplary writings of the Beat poets and novelists. Selections from the Beat classics appear, as well as more recent prose and poetry demonstrating the continued vitality of the Beat experiment. Included are short biographies of the contributors, an extensive bibliography of Beat literature, and a unique guide to “Beat places” around the world—from Kerouac’s hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, where his novel Dr. Sax takes place, to Tangier, where Burroughs wrote parts of Naked Lunch.","2007","1"

Because of Deliverance the Chattooga looms enigmatically in our sharedimagination, as iconic as Twain's Mississippi--or maybe Conrad's Congo.This is John Lane's search for the real Chattooga--for the truths that reside somewhere in the river's rapids, along its shores, or in its travelers' hearts. Lane balances the dark, indifferent mythical river of Deliverance against the Chattooga known to locals and to the outdoors enthusiasts who first mastered its treacherous vortices and hydraulics. Starting at its headwaters, Lane leads us down the river and through its complex history to its current status as a National Wild and Scenic River. Along the way he stops for talks with conservation activists, seventh-generation residents, locals who played parts in the movie, day visitors, and others. Lane weaves into each encounter an abundance of details drawn from his perceptive readings and viewings of Deliverance and his wide-ranging knowledge of the Chattooga watershed. At the end of his run, Lane leaves us still fully possessed by the Chattooga's mystery, yet better informed about its place in his world and ours.John Lane's writing has been published in American Whitewater, Southern Review, Terra Nova, and Fourth Genre. His books include Waist Deep in Black Water (Georgia), several volumes of poetry, and Weed Time, a gathering of his essays. Lane is an associate professor of English at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina.Publishers WeeklyThis extended personal narrative by poet and author Lane (Waist Deep in Black Water) focuses on the Chattooga River, which runs along the border of Georgia and South Carolina. The river and the ""isolated, rugged mountain landscape"" through which it runs were the setting for James Dickey's 1970 novel Deliverance and its 1972 film adaptation, about a group of suburban men whose canoeing trip becomes a face-off with torture and death. Lane thinks that Dickey's tale was ""one of the central adventure stories of my generation,"" which told of a ""hero's journey of separation, initiation and return."" Having previously explored the river, Lane returns to journey the entire length of it, describing its natural beauty and danger as well as pausing to view it through the prism of Dickey's book. In the best parts, Lane artfully applies his poetic sensibility to the river itself, such as when he describes the results of a heavy rainfall: ""the highway swings around swells of native rock, the runoff peels into the Chattooga drainage, burbling through culverts and ping-ponging off stream pebbles weathered from the old Appalachian range."" Equally enjoyable, though less moving, are Lane's portraits of local residents and their views about the book and film, which did not paint a flattering picture of the area and its citizens. The weakest parts are those where Lane directly compares the river with aspects of Dickey's book. Lane's own writing and observations are good enough to stand outside of Dickey's considerable shadow.

"Ethnic Modernism","Werner Sollors","9780674030916","In the first half of the twentieth century, the United States moved from the periphery to the center of global cultural production. At the same time, technologies of dissemination evolved rapidly, and versions of modernism emerged as dominant art forms. How did African American, European immigrant, and other minority writers take part in these developments that also transformed the United States, giving it an increasingly multicultural self-awareness? This book attempts to address this question in a series of innovative and engaging close readings of major texts by Gertrude Stein, Mary Antin, Jean Toomer, O. E. Rölvaag, Nathan Asch, Henry Roth, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Pietro di Donato, Jerre Mangione, John Hersey, and Leo Szilard, as well as briefer examinations of many other authors and works, against the background of international political developments, the rise of modernism in the visual arts, and the ascendancy of Ernest Hemingway as a model for prose writers. In many of Werner Sollors’s sensitive readings, single sentences and paragraphs serve as the representative formal units of prose works, while throughout Ethnic Modernism the trolley (now a cute-seeming object of nostalgia) emerges with surprising frequency as a central thematic emblem of modernity.","2008","3"

"Every Shut Eye Ain't Asleep; An Anthology of Poetry by African Americans since 1945","Michael S. Harper","9780316347105","Every Shut Eye Ain't Asleep is a rich collection of the work of post-World War II African-American poets. It brings together the voices of the most important African-American poets of our time, beginning with the highly influential Robert Hayden and Gwendolyn Brooks, and covers an astonishing range of styles and techniques. This extraordinary body of poetry is the flowering of an artistic tradition established earlier in this century by Paul Laurence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, and Langston Hughes. The newer work comprises many different visions, ranging from the chiseled and layered modernism of Jay Wright to the plainspoken ferocity of Sonia Sanchez, from the dazzling witticisms of Ishmael Reed to the plangent lyricism of Rita Dove. Edited by the distinguished poet Michael Harper and his star student and colleague Anthony Walton, this notable collection of work will be the standard anthology in the field for years to come.Library JournalUsing Robert Hayden and Gwendolyn Brooks's poetry as ``emblematic'' successes, this anthology selects 35 African American poets (spanning three generations) who were born between 1913 and 1962 and came of age after 1945. Besides the well-known Amiri Baraka, Lucille Clifton, Rita Dove, and Etheridge Knight, the editors feature little-known or younger poets like Elizabeth Alexander, Gerald Barrax, Jayne Cortex, and Dolores Kendrick. (Curiously, James Baldwin, Nikki Giovanni, June Jordan, and Quincy Troupe are omitted.) With an introduction, headnotes, and selective bibliographies, this valuable work from a mainstream press updates Robert Hayden's Afro-American Literature, Dudley Randall's New Black Voices , and Abraham Chapman's New Black Voices .

"The Civil Rights Reader: American Literature from Jim Crow to Reconciliation","Julie Buckner Armstrong","9780820332253","This anthology of drama, essays, fiction, and poetry presents a thoughtful, classroom-tested selection of the best literature for learning about the long civil rights movement. Unique in its focus on creative writing, the volume also ranges beyond a familiar 1954-68 chronology to include works from the 1890s to the present. The civil rights movement was a complex, ongoing process of defining national values such as freedom, justice, and equality. In ways that historical documents cannot, these collected writings show how Americans negotiated this process--politically, philosophically, emotionally, spiritually, and creatively.Gathered here are works by some of the most influential writers to engage issues of race and social justice in America, including James Baldwin, Flannery O'Connor, Amiri Baraka, and Nikki Giovanni. The volume begins with works from the post-Reconstruction period when racial segregation became legally sanctioned and institutionalized. This section, titled ""The Rise of Jim Crow,"" spans the period from Frances E. W. Harper's Iola Leroy to Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. In the second section, ""The Fall of Jim Crow,"" Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""Letter from Birmingham Jail"" and a chapter from The Autobiography of Malcolm X appear alongside poems by Robert Hayden, June Jordan, and others who responded to these key figures and to the events of the time. ""Reflections and Continuing Struggles,"" the last section, includes works by such current authors as Rita Dove, Anthony Grooms, and Patricia J. Williams. These diverse perspectives on the struggle for civil rights can promote the kinds of conversations that we, as a nation, still need to initiate.","2009","3"
"Voices from the Harlem Renaissance","Nathan Irvin Huggins","9780195093605","The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s symbolized black liberation and sophistication - the final shaking off of slavery from the minds, spirits, and characters of African Americans. It was a period when the African American came of age - when the ""New Negro"" was born - with the clearest expression of this transformation visible in its remarkable outpouring of literature, art, and music. In Voices from the Harlem Renaissance, Nathan Irvin Huggins provides more than 120 selections from the political writings, literature, and art of this watershed period. Bringing together the most trenchant works from such writers as Langston Hughes, Nancy Cunard, Alain Locke, and Zora Neale Hurston, this fascinating collection depicts the impact of Harlem and New York City on those who lived there. While focusing on the youthfulness and exuberance of the period, Huggins attends to the voices of alienation, anger, and rage - whether softly intoned or stridently voiced - so widely reflected in the writing of poets such as George S. Schuyler and Gwendolyn Bennett. Also included are over twenty paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance period by such artists as Aaron Douglas, Sargent Johnson, and Hale Woodruff. The vitality of the Harlem Renaissance served as a generative force for all New York - and the nation. Offering all those interested in the evolution of African-American consciousness and art a link to this glorious time, Voices of the Harlem Renaissance illuminates the African-American struggle for self-realization.","1995","5"

"How God Fix Jonah","Lorenz Graham","9781563976988","""Utterly delightful"" is how Zora Neal Hurston described this book when it was first published in 1946. Long out of print, Lorenz Graham's beautiful collection of Bible stories, told in the idiom of West Africa, is available again in an expanded edition newly illustrated by Ashley Bryan. This revised edition includes a foreword by Effie Lee Morris, along with the original foreword by W. E. B. Du Bois. Together they provide an appreciation of the work of Lorenz Graham and his classic book.(Booklist) - Hazel RochmanThe son of an African Methodist Episcopal minister in California, Graham taught in a missionary school in Liberia in the 1920s. He wrote this collection of biblical story-poems, which he published in 1946, in the voices of West African teachers and students. Now the collection has been reissued in a handsome volume with dramatic, new, full-page block prints by Ashley Bryan. The stories, great for reading aloud, have the simplicity and rhythm of the oral tradition. Both colloquial and poetic, they bring the holy into daily life. There's Noah (""God Wash the World and Start Again""), Solomon (""Wise Sword Find True Mommy""), Ruth, Samson, and many others. There are also a few selections from the New Testament, among them, ""Make glad all people / God's pican be born in Bethlehem."" The word pican, with its racist associations to picaninny, may be a problem with some readers, but as Graham explains in his introduction, the original word, meaning baby, son, or child, was used with great tenderness up and down the West African coast. It would be a shame to deprive today's children of this newly illustrated collection, endorsed by leading black authors, educators, and political leaders, because of the occasional use of this word. Most beautiful is the story of the Prodigal Son, told with a dramatic simplicity that's just right for readers' theater: the wastrel son's return and celebration, the good son's complaint to his father (""I work, I work, I work, I never left you. All the time you never kill one small goat for me. How you do me so?""), and the moving reply (""He was dead and now he live. He ain't got nothin. And he hungry"").

Also included are the banned essays from Mumia's controversial tenure as on-air columnist for All Things Considered, and those that aired on Democracy Now over Pacifica Radio. Also included is a one-hour CD of Mumia Abu-Jamal reading his on-air pieces written for All Things Considered and commentary from Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Adrienne Rich, Howard Zinn, and many others.Publishers WeeklyTo some, Abu-Jamal, convicted in the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia police officer, is a cold-blooded cop killer, but to his supporters, the death-row inmate is a hero, wrongly condemned by a racist system. In this collection of forceful prison essays and radio talks written over the last decade (a sequel to Live from Death Row and Death Blossoms), former Black Panther Abu-Jamal maintains that he was targeted by the state because of his political beliefs and associations. He cites a recent Amnesty International report that calls for a new trial on the grounds that his 1982 trial was riddled with procedural errors and quite possibly contaminated by racism. Hanrahan, director of Prison Radio (which aired several of these commentaries after Abu-Jamal was pulled off the air by NPR's All Things Considered), describes Abu-Jamal's life in solitary confinement as a living hell and accuses prison authorities of constant harassment and censorship. Whatever one thinks of Abu-Jamal's guilt or innocence, his attack on capital punishment as a discriminatory, racist practice is compelling, as is his critique of our bloated prison system, which, according to an American Bar Association report cited here, is self-defeating because dehumanizing conditions produce more criminals. An outspoken political analyst, Abu-Jamal condemns Clinton's adoption of NAFTA, calls the war on drugs largely a ""War on Blacks"" and offers incisive commentary on rap music, the decline of African-American community life, police brutality and recent developments in Mexico, Peru, Iran and South Africa.

"Basali!: Stories by and about Women in Lesotho","K. Limakatso Kendall","9780869809181","Basali! means 'women' and is one of the most common exclamations in the Sesotho language. Usually uttered by a woman and delivered with a laugh, a shaking of the head, or a clapping of hands, Basali! evokes Basotho women's admiration and wonderment for themselves and each other. These stories in 'Sesotho-ised' English reveal a way of life and a way of perceiving experience that is unique in African literature. The stories offer glimpses of traditional healers, circumcision schools, witches, bride-prices, and extended rural family life. There are families disrupted by migrant labour, women and men brutalised by apartheid, teenagers who violate tradition, and middle-class office-workers whose rural families live by a different click than the one that ticks for them. The focus of each story is the decisions women make, the actions they take to protect and to provide for themselves and their children, and to care for the people they love.","1995","7"

"Literary Fort Worth","Judy Alter","9780875652535","Aware that some may see the title of this volume as an oxymoron, James Ward Lee argues in his “Argumentative Introduction” that for more than a century Fort Worth writers have written well about a city too often dismissed as a semi-rural cow town. Writers have celebrated its world of cattle and oil, to be sure, but many have seen other sides of Fort Worth—the country club set, the literati, the artists and artisans, the musicians, the intellectuals, and the whole minority sub-culture that has given a cosmopolitan tone to the Queen City of the Prairies. Fort Worth is in many ways the most typical of Texas cities—proud of its slogan of “Cowtown and Culture.” People mingle as easily at the new Bass Hall, with its world-class visiting entertainers and the Van Cliburn Piano Competition, as they do at the White Elephant Saloon or the Cowtown Coliseum. They visit a museum complex unrivalled anywhere in the world for a city Fort Worth's size, and they attend the Southwest Exposition and Livestock Show. Lee and Judy Alter, both Fort Worth residents and well-known writers themselves, found passages in novels, short stories, and poetry that caught the city's atmosphere and odd bits of its history. And they found that some of the best writing done about Cowtown is journalistic rather than what is usually considered literary. There are articles by current and former members of the staff of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and one particularly poignant piece about the last day of the old Fort Worth Press. Literary Fort Worth is a literary smorgasbord, with something to appeal to almost any reader's taste. And literary? You bet!","2002","0"

In his introduction to this year’s edition, Adam Gopnik finds that great essays have text and inner text, personal story and larger point, the thing you’re supposed to be paying attention to and some other thing you’re really interested in.” David Sedaris’s quirky, hilarious account of a childhood spent yearning for a home where history was properly respected is also a poignant rumination on surviving the passage of time. In The Ecstasy of Influence,” Jonathan Lethem ponders the intriguing phenomenon of cryptomnesia: a person believes herself to be creating something new but is really recalling similar, previously encountered work. Ariel Levy writes in The Lesbian Bride’s Handbook” of her efforts to plan a party that accurately reflects her lifestyle (which she notes is not black-tie!”) as she confronts head-on what it means to be married. And Lauren Slater is off to Tripp Lake,” recounting the one summer she spent at campa summer of color wars, horseback riding, and the wild sadness” that settled in her when she was away from home. In the end, Gopnik believes that the only real ambition of an essayist is to be a master of our common life. This latest installment of The Best American Essays is full of writing that reveals, in Gopnik’s words, the breath of things as they are.”","2008","2"

"Hokum: An Anthology of African-American Humor","Paul Beatty","9781596911482","Selected and introduced by acclaimed novelist and poet Paul Beatty, Hokum is a liberating, eccentric, savagely comic collection of the funniest writing by black Americans. This book is less a comprehensive collection of African-American humor than a mix-tape narrative dubbed by a trusted frienda sampler of underground classics, rare grooves, and timeless summer jams, poetry and prose juxtaposed with the blues, hip-hop, political speeches, and the world's funniest radio sermon. The subtle musings of Toni Cade Bambara, Henry Dumas, and Harryette Mullen are bracketed by the profane and often loud ruminations of Langston Hughes, Darius James, Wanda Coleman, Tish Benson, Steve Cannon, and Hattie Gossett. Some of the funniest writers don't write, so included are selections from well-known yet unpublished wits Lightnin' Hopkins, Mike Tyson, and the Reverend Al Sharpton. Selections also come from public figures and authors whose humor, although incisive and profound, is often overlooked: Malcolm X, Suzan-Lori Parks, Zora Neale Hurston, Sojourner Truth, and W.E.B. Dubois. Groundbreaking, fierce, and hilarious, this is a necessary anthology for any fan or student of American writing, with a huge range and a smart, political grasp of the uses of humor.Publishers WeeklyAcclaimed novelist Beatty (Tuff; White Boy Shuffle) models this controversial anthology on a ""mix-tape narrative dubbed by a trusted... friend."" Like a mix-tape, the collection is intensely personal: its encompassing feature is the bright, plaintive, scathingly ironic voice that introduces the volume and its various sections. Beatty, who ""was the butt of the first joke [he'd] ever heard,"" mines two centuries of African-American culture for speeches, poems, fiction, comics and screenplays that mirror his own glass-cutting wit and satisfy, in places, his taste for ""unintentional comedy."" (To wit, ""The Wit and Wisdom of Mike Tyson."") Apart from usual suspects like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, a Norton anthology this is not. Selections from Fran Ross and Prophet Omega dizzy readers in their logical funhouses. Hattie Gossett's ""80s Version of the Dozens"" leads them through sewer pipes of lyrical imagination. The volume's general tenor is wild, winking and explosive. As such, it picks up where Chappelle's Show left off-gouging the government, lampooning cultures black and white, leaving no sacred cow unslaughtered. Even the smiling watermelon on the book's front cover has been retained despite sniffs by national media outlets. ""This is black humor,"" Beatty writes, ""and I don't mean African-American black."" Indeed, at times-as when John Farris's schoolchildren blithely gun down pedestrians-you may need night-vision goggles to find the joke. (Jan.) Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.","2006","2"
"Nickel and Dimed","Joan Holden","9780822220428","Can a middle-aged, middle-class woman survive, when she suddenly has to make beds all day in a hotel and live on $7 an hour? Maybe. But one $7-an-hour job won t pay the rent: she ll have to do back-to-back shifts, as a chambermaid and a waitress. This isn t the first surprise for acclaimed author Barbara, who set out to research low-wage life firsthand, confident she was prepared for the worst. Barbara Ehrenreich s best-seller about her odyssey is vivid and witty, yet always deeply sobering. Joan Holden s stage adaptation is a focused comic epic shadowed with tragedy. Barbara is prepared for hard work but not, at 55, for double shifts and nonstop aches and pains; for having to share tiny rooms, live on fast food because she has no place to cook, beg from food pantries, gulp handfuls of Ibuprofen because she can t afford a doctor; for failing, after all that, to make ends meet; or for constantly having to swallow humiliation. The worst, she learns, is not what happens to the back or the knees: it s the damage to the heart. The bright glimpses of Barbara s co-workers that enliven the book become indelible portraits: Gail, the star waitress pushing fifty who can no longer outrun her troubles; Carlie, the hotel maid whose rage has burned down to disgust; Pete, the nursing home cook who retreats into fantasy; Holly, terrified her pregnancy will end her job as Team Leader at Magic Maids, and with it her 50-cent raise. These characters wage their life struggles with a gallantry that humbles Barbara, and the audience. The play shows us the life a third of working Americans now lead, and makes us angry that anyone should have to live it.Philadelphia InquirerInvolving, important and urgently topical.","2005","7"
"Double-Take: A Revisionist Harlem Renaissance Anthology","Venetria Patton","9780813529301","Arranged by author, 23 essays and 155 creative pieces represent the artistic and intellectual range of the Harlem Renaissance. Featuring the work of women and men in equal numbers, and including overlooked writers as well as the major figures of the period, the book assembles poetry, short stories, drama, essays, and song lyrics. Artwork and illustrations from periodicals of the time are also included. Essays discuss the history of Harlem, jazz, discrimination against African Americans, and sexism. Brief biographies precede the work of each writer. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)Library JournalWith this new anthology of Harlem Renaissance literature, Patton (Women in Chains: The Legacy of Slavery in Black Women's Fiction) and Honey (editor, Shadowed Dreams: Women's Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance), both at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, attempt to ""restore and underline the importance of women's writing"" and sexual orientation to the Harlem Renaissance. The balanced selection of women and men is similar to that found in Henry Louis Gates's Norton Anthology of African American Literature (LJ 2/01/97), but the inclusion of lesser-known figures and works is aimed at focusing on the ideology of the renaissance, gay and lesbian themes, and differences in gender-based issues. Countee Cullen, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston are among the authors represented, and the selected works include essays, poetry, prose, and drama, with lyrics and visual art used as illustration. The editors also break with the tendency to define the beginning and end of the renaissance with political events by focusing on specific literary works, which allows them to broaden the period to 1916-37. Both editors have done previous research in the field of African American women's literature and include a biographical sketch of each writer to underline how their gender, class, and sexual orientation shaped their work.

"The Best American Short Stories 2001","Barbara Kingsolver","9780395926888","This year’s Best American Short Stories is edited by the critically acclaimed and best-selling author Barbara Kingsolver, whose latest book is Prodigal Summer. Kingsolver’s selections for The Best American Short Stories 2001 showcase a wide variety of new voices and masters, such as Alice Munro, Rick Moody, Dorothy West, and John Updike. Reading these stories was both a distraction from and an anchor to the complexities of my life  my pleasure, my companionship, my salvation. I hope they will be yours.”  Barbara Kingsolver Publishers WeeklyIf the 20 stories in this year's collection have any one thing in common, it is their substance and seriousness of purpose. This is mostly a good thing entries by veteran writers like Alice Munro, John Updike and Annette Sanford, and by relative newcomers like Andrea Barrett, Barbara Klein Moss and Peter Orner are intellectually stimulating and satisfying but the inclusion of a few lighter selections might have leavened the mix. Munro is her usual magical self in ""Post and Beam,"" in which a young Vancouver wife comes to terms with the immutability of married life. Ha Jin, in ""After Cowboy Chicken Came to Town,"" tells of the impact an American fast food franchise in China has on both employees and customers, imparting a number of reasons why East and West will never see eye to eye. ""Servants of the Map,"" the extraordinary novella- length story by Barrett, tells the tale of an English mapmaker in 1860s India struggling with his demanding job, loneliness and, most of all, his unquenchable desire to be a botanist. In Orner's brief tale, ""The Raft,"" a grandfather ushers his grandson into a closet to tell him an old WWII story in a new way. Sanford's contribution short, too tells how a 16-year-old girl seemingly doing nothing for the summer is preparing for adult life. The careful character development, subtle drama and pristine prose of these selections should once again thoroughly satisfy fans of quality short fiction. $200,000 marketing campaign; sweepstakes promotion.

Fourteen eclectic pieces, half of which are by major playwrights, comprise the latest volume in Applause's long-running annual celebration of the form. The most unusual work is a recently rediscovered text by Thornton Wilder, The Wreck of the 5:25, anthologized here for the first time. This play alone casts into clear relief the adventurous nature of contemporary playwrights (though the sparsity of major women playwrights here is notable). The Humana Festival, held at the Actors' Theatre in Louisville, has long been a venue for new plays. This fat collection contains the cream of two decades' worth of work. As fewer major playwrights are represented, these plays are more risky, more adventurous, and much more political. By and large, they test the limits of the form more rigorously than those found in the Applause collection. Both texts provide a wealth of source material for theaters, actors, and academic training programs. Both are recommended for academic and larger public libraries.Thomas E.

The 2002 collection includes stories about everything from illicit love affairs to family, the immigrant experience and badly behaved children -- stories varied in subject but unified in their power and humanity. In the words of this year's guest editor, the best-selling author Sue Miller, ""The American short story today [is] healthy and strong . . . These stories arrived in the nick of time . . . to teach me once more what we read fiction for.""Library JournalThis year's edition of the popular short story anthology contains many pieces that focus on the past as either a setting or a counterpoint to the protagonist's current life. As guest editor Miller states in her introduction, the realist story seems to have taken hold as the American form of this art. There is very little experimental writing, except perhaps in the trend toward covering a surprisingly broad span of time in a short amount of space. The always reliable Alice Munro gives us a fascinating character sketch in ""Family Furnishings."" In Akhil Sharma's ""Surrounded by Sleep,"" a young Hindu boy's most comforting image of God is a cardigan-clad Clark Kent. And both E.L.

Lorrie Moore brings her keen eye for wit and surprise to the volume, and The Best American Short Stories 2004 is an eclectic and enthralling gathering of well-known voices and talented up-and-comers. Here are stories that probe the biggest issues: ambition, gender, romance, war. Here are funny and touching and striking tales of a Spokane Indian, the estranged wife of an Iranian immigrant, an American tutor in Bombay. In her introduction Lorrie Moore writes, ""The stories collected here impressed me with their depth of knowledge and feeling of character, setting, and situation . . . They spoke with amused intelligence, compassion, and dispassion.""Publishers WeeklyMoore takes a tried and true tack in this current edition of the popular series, choosing solid stories that rely more on careful character development and seamless writing than on inventiveness or stylistic flash. The results are occasionally stodgy, but there are plenty of satisfying entries, if few startling ones. Family relations are a recurring theme, and two stories of note unearth family ghosts. In John Edgar Wideman's ""What We Cannot Speak About We Must Pass Over in Silence,"" a man is enmeshed in the life of his deceased friend's jailed son; in Trudy Lewis's ""Limestone Diner,"" a grandmother comes to terms with her past through the tragic accident of a local girl. Most stories are firmly rooted in the U.S., but a few roam cautiously afield. In ""The Tutor,"" set in India, Nell Freudenberger explores the dynamics of an expatriate father and daughter relationship; ""Mirror Studies"" by Mary Yukari Waters takes place in Japan and interestingly weaves in monkey studies. The selection favors well-known writers, including Alice Munro, Annie Proulx and John Updike, and some readers may wish for a more varied lineup-the New Yorker is the source of eight of the 20 entries-but there's no arguing with the power of most of these offerings by the heavy hitters of the contemporary canon.

The poems included in this anthology, except for Elizabeth Alexander’s inauguration poem, were all written no more than a day before they appeared on the popular blog “Starting Today: Poems for the First 100 Days” . The result is a work that documents the political and personal events of those crucial days through a variety of contemporary poetic voices, from the ebullient to the admiring, from the pithy to the loquacious.Publishers WeeklyThis varied anthology began as a blog—the editors sent out a call to poets asking them to write original poems on an assigned day during the critical first 100 days of Obama's presidency, responding somehow to the day's news; the results were published daily online. The book that the blog became begins with Elizabeth Alexander's inaugural poem (“Say it plain: that many have died for this day”) and continues with 99 other pieces by poets young and old, including Cornelius Eady, David Lehman, and Mark Doty.

This book is divided into four major areas of literary inquiry: analyses of the psychic relations between the Latino/a subject and its mimetic others; explorations of the complexities of race and Afro-Latino/a poetics; studies of the representation of labor in the Latino/a literary imagination; and genealogical and archival assessment of U.S. Latino literature’s relationship with American, Caribbean, and Latin American literatures and histories.","2007","5"

With the expert help of Candy Moulton he has succeeded in collecting eighteen stories set in the Working West after 1920 that meet his inflexible requirements: experience plus imagination plus innate writing ability.  As Evans notes in his introduction, subdivisions, condos, and ranchettes are shrinking the Working West every day: ""Some of those who once lived it, and those few who are so agonizingly still working it with bloodied souls, must put it down on paper. . . . If we fail to act with immediacy the truth will continue to dissipate. . . with frightening rapidity."" The stories in this anthology range as wide as the Rockies, from a murder mystery to the tale of a unique horse trainer, to a family's desperate battle against a grass and forest fire to the story of a world famous violinist. But they share a common denominator: biscuits. Almost every story includes hot biscuits as a feature of daily life in the Working West. Biscuits, it turns out, are more important in western life than guns and maybe more than coffee. In the West, people who could make superior biscuits received more respect than the mayor and the police chief combined. The authors of the stories in Hot Biscuits are Taylor Fogerty, J. P. S.

"American Fantastic Tales Boxed Set","Peter Straub","9781598530599","From its beginning, American literature teems with tales of horror, hauntings, terrifying obsessions and gruesome incursions, of the uncanny ways in which ordinary reality can be breached and subverted by the unknown and the irrational. In the tales of Irving, Poe, and Hawthorne, and their literary successors, the bright prospects of the New World face an uneasy reckoning with the forces of darkness. As this pathbreaking two-volume anthology demonstrates, it is a tradition with many unexpected detours and hidden chambers, and one that continues to evolve, finding new forms and new themes. Peter Straub, a contemporary master of literary horror and fantasy, offers an authoritative and diverse gathering of stories calculated to unsettle and delight, in styles ranging from the exquisitely insinuating speculations of Henry James's ""The Jolly Corner"" to the nightmarish post-apocalyptic savagery of Harlan Ellison's ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream."" Ghostly narratives of the Edwardian era, lurid classics from the pulp heyday of Weird Tales, latter-day masterpieces by Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, and Steven Millhauser: over 80 stories in all, with a generous selection of contemporary authors who continue to push the genre in new and startling directions.","2009","1"

"Sisters of the Earth: Women's Prose and Poetry About Nature","Lorraine Anderson","9781400033218","Sisters of the Earth is a stirring collection of women’s writing on nature: Nature as healer. Nature as delight. Nature as mother and sister. Nature as victim. Nature as companion and reminder of what is wild in us all. Here, among more than a hundred poets and prose writers, are Diane Ackerman on the opium of sunsets; Ursula K. Le Guin envisioning an alternative world in which human beings are not estranged from their planet; and Julia Butterfly Hill on weathering a fierce storm in the redwood tree where she lived for more than two years. Here, too, are poems, essays, stories, and journal entries by Emily Dickinson, Alice Walker, Terry Tempest Williams, Willa Cather, Gretel Erlich, Adrienne Rich, and others—each offering a vivid, eloquent response to the natural world.This second edition of Sisters of the Earth is fully revised and updated with a new preface and nearly fifty new pieces, including new contributions by Louise Erdrich, Pam Houston, Zora Neale Hurston, Starhawk, Joy Williams, Kathleen Norris, Rita Dove, and Barbara Kingsolver.Publishers WeeklyThe voices of nearly 100 women--white, black, Native American--sing out in this luminous anthology, which spans centuries, genres and literary careers from Willa Cather's to Sue Hubbell's. The thread that binds together the poetry, short stories and essays collected here is the harmonious relationship between women and nature that is about ``caring rather than controlling,'' as editor Anderson indicates. In her poem ``My Help Is in the Mountainsic ,'' Nancy Wood ( Hollering Sun ) becomes part of the sun-warmed rock that soothes her ``earthly wounds.'' In a prose reflection, ``The Miracle of Renewal,'' Laura Lee Davidson is rejuvenated by a year spent in the Canadian woods in 1914, which provided her with a ``gallery of mind-pictures.'' Both Linda Hogan's essay, ``Walking,'' and Elizabeth Coatsworth's poem, ``On the Hills,'' seek and find continuity in nature, as well as a kinship with the other times and places that is evoked by it. Taste and sensitivity are evident throughout the volume, whether tacit as nocturnal solitude or vocal as a feline ``howl . . . for the flame of yellow moons'' in Judith Minty's poem, ``Why Do You Keep Those Cats?''

This hefty tome features many significant essays, poems, and stories not readily available to all scholars that are drawn from African American journals of the period, including Opportunity, Crisis, and Fire! In his introduction, Lewis carefully explores tension within this arts and letters movement. The collected excerpts of writers like Cullen, Hurston, Hughes, McKay, DuBois, and Wright represent a balance between those Renaissance supporters and writers who ``saw the small cracks in the wall of racism that could, they anticipated, be widened through the production of exemplary racial images'' and those who ``saw art not as politics by other means--civil rights between covers or from a stage or an easel.''

A black hero marries a white woman. A slave mother kills her child by a rapist-master. A white-looking person of partly African ancestry passes for white. A master and a slave change places for a single night. An interracial marriage turns sour. The birth of a child brings a crisis. Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of An Anthology of Interracial Literature. This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that crossor are crossed bywhat came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from Arabian Nights and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems. The authors of the selections include some of the great names of world literature interspersed with lesser-known writers. Themes of interracial love and family relations, passing, and the figure of the Mulatto are threaded through the volume. An Anthology of Interracial Literature allows scholars, students, and general readers to grapple with the extraordinary diversity in world literature. As multi-racial identification becomes more widespread the ethnic and cultural roots of world literature takes on new meaning. Contributors include: Hans Christian Andersen, Gwendolyn Brooks, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Charles W. Chesnutt, Lydia MariaChild, Kate Chopin, Countee Cullen, Caroline Bond Day, Rita Dove, Alexandre Dumas, Olaudah Equiano, Langston Hughes, Victor Hugo, Charles Johnson, Adrienne Kennedy, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Guy de Maupassant, Claude McKay, Eugene O'Neill, Alexander Pushkin, and Jean Toomer.Library JournalSollors (English literature &amp; Afro-American studies, Harvard) has compiled the first scholarly anthology that centers on the theme in literature of love and family across, or crossed by, racial boundaries. As Sollors explains in the introduction, ""It is a theme that makes for unusual intersections of the plots of love and family relations with issues of society and politics."" The anthology contains a broad range of texts, including epics, poems, and novellas, and spans numerous cultures from the ancient to the contemporary. The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks. One is reminded that color was an accidental quality in antiquity and the Christian Middle Ages; that during later times, censure existed; and that, in the United States in particular, interracial marriage bans were not deemed unconstitutional until 1967.

"Brooklyn Was Mine","Chris Knutsen","9781594482823","A tribute to New York City's most literary borough-featuring original nonfiction pieces by today's most celebrated writers. Of all the urban landscapes in America, perhaps none has so thoroughly infused and nurtured modern literature as Brooklyn. Though its literary history runs deep-Walt Whitman, Truman Capote, and Norman Mailer are just a few of its storied inhabitants-in recent years the borough has seen a growing concentration of bestselling novelists, memoirists, poets, and journalists. It has become what Greenwich Village once was for an earlier generation: a wellspring of inspiration and artistic expression. Brooklyn Was Mine gives some of today's best writers an opportunity to pay tribute to the borough they love in 20 original essays that draw on past and present to create a mosaic that brilliantly captures the quality and diversity of a unique, literary landscape. Contributors include: Emily Barton, Susan Choi, Rachel Cline, Philip Dray, Jennifer Egan, Colin Harrison, Joanna Hershon, Jonathan Lethem, Dinaw Mengestu, Elizabeth Gaffney, Lara Vapnyar, Lawrence Osborne, Katie Roiphe, John Burnham Schwartz, Vijay Seshadri, Darcey Steinke, Darin Strauss, Alexandra Styron, Robert Sullivan  With an introduction by Phillip Lopate.Norman Oder - Library JournalPlace, idea, and contested symbol, as essayist Phillip Lopate allows in his introduction, Brooklyn harbors a new generation of writers, who offer a good variety of essays on places and people they know. Russian emigre Lara Vapnyar recalls the Russian ""parody"" of Brighton Beach; John Burnham Schwartz brings his father back to no-longer-Jewish Brownsville; Ethiopian-born Dinaw Mengestu revels in polyglot Kensington; and Lawrence Osborne finds commonality between waterfront Red Hook and his former stomping grounds in Bangkok. Several pieces are miniatures-e.g., Emily Barton on her seltzer man-while Colin Harrison is one of a few with a broader canvas, describing how youth baseball has taken him and his son around the borough. There's almost nothing about black and Caribbean Brooklyn and not enough about the borough's ongoing transformation, though gentrification is a recurring theme. Novelist Jonathan Lethem, almost a professional Brooklynite, offers a hybrid piece titled ""Ruckus Flatbush,"" offering sardonic insider wordplay, then reflecting on his role fighting ""shockingly bad"" redevelopment; Vijay Seshadri, assaying changes in his neighborhood of Carroll Gardens, once mostly Italian and Hispanic, acknowledges ""the commonplace but nonetheless sharp recognition that I only began cherishing it when I understood it was disappearing."" Walt Whitman, source of the book's title, might agree. For essay collections, especially where New York is of interest.","2008","5"
"Out of Her Mind: Women Writing on Madness","Rebecca Shannonhouse","9780375755026","Out of Her Mind, edited by Rebecca Shannonhouse, captures the best literature by and about women struggling with madness. A remarkable chronicle of gifted and unconventional women who have spun their inner turmoil into literary gold, the collection features classic short stories, breathtaking literary excerpts, key historical writings, and previously unpublished letters by Zelda Fitzgerald.Shannonhouse’s recent anthology, Under the Influence: The Literature of Addiction, is also available as a Modern Library Paperback Original.Library JournalThis somewhat uneven collection by freelance writer Shannonhouse focuses not on the experience of mental illness but rather on descriptions of those experiences (both first-and secondhand) written by women, making the subject matter fairly unique. The time span of the 21 brief selections is impressive (1436-1999); however, almost two-thirds of the writings are from the last half of the 20th century. The wide range of work includes arresting first-person descriptions of mental illness and the equally riveting 1843 testimony of Dorothea Dix on the conditions of Massaschusetts insane assylums.

They present a general introduction as well as brief introductions to each selection in this anthology of poetry, essays, and stories. The strength and range of voices heard here will intrigue and enlighten a wide audience. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, ORPublishers WeeklyEditors Dunn and Comfort (Breaking Boundaries) bring together more than 50 pieces by almost as many authors and poets in this useful but somewhat frustrating anthology of work by Native women from the U.S. and Canada. Selections span time (the earliest pieces are from Mourning Dove and Ella Cara Deloria from the 1920s and 1930s) and numerous tribal traditions throughout North America. Centering on women's experiences, the first section concerns images of birth and creation; subsequent chapters deal with marriage and family, and women's powers and mysteries. Among works from well-known women writers are the prologue from Paula Gunn Allen's The Woman Who Owned the Shadows, and poems by Joy Harjo (""Deer Dancer"" and ""Wolf Warrior""), Luci Tapahonso (""Above the Canyon Floor"") and Ines Hernandez-Avila (""Grandpa's Song for Little Bear""). Louise Erdrich is represented (in a selection from her novel Tracks), and so are Beth Brant (""Coyote Learns a New Trick"") and Leslie Silko (material from Storyteller). Such new and emerging voices as Shaunna McCovey, Cheryl Savageau and Deborah Miranda are each accorded two selections. The collection, however, seems unbalanced. Many of the pieces, particularly those from the more noted writers, have appeared elsewhere, and most of these writers are represented by one brief entry, while lesser figures are granted more space. There are also curious omissions: there is nothing by E. Pauline Johnson, whom Beth Brant has described as the mother of Native women's literature. But despite its idiosyncrasies, there is enough material here to interest those already familiar with Native American literature, and to entice the uninitiated. (Jan.)

"Nineteenth-Century American Poetry","Various","9780140435870","Compiled to suggest what nineteenth-century America contributed to the history of poetry, rather than what poetry may contribute to a history of nineteenth-century America, this volume emphasizes those poets who have survived the Modernist revolution over those left behind. And so it is Whitman, Dickinson, and Melville who occupy the center of this anthology; these are the poets in whose ability to speak directly to our ears modern poetry has recognized its forebears. But only when these poetic innovators are read alongside the recognized giants of their day can we begin to see how truly extraordinary they are, and why they remained undervalued, unread, or altogether unknown in their own time. William C. Spengemann and Jessica F. Roberts have gathered nearly three hundred poems, spanning the course of the century: from Joel Barlow to Edwin Arlington Robinson, by way of Bryant, Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier, Poe, Holmes, Jones Very, Thoreau, Lowell, Lanier, and the largely forgotten Frederick Goddard Tuckerman and Sarah Morgan Piatt.","1996","1"
"Literature of the American South: A Norton Anthology","William L. Andrews","9780393316711","For nearly four centuries, the American South has been home to a vital literary tradition.Publishers WeeklyWriting from his experience as a professor of American and English literature at the University of Kentucky, Bryant has compiled here a thorough guidehe calls it a ""primer""to the literary output of 20th-century Southerners. From this premise, Bryant is able to include writers like Ralph Ellison, James Agee and William Styron who migrated north but whose works nonetheless both inform and are informed by the regional experience of the South. In more or less chronological order, Bryant leads the reader from the early plantation fiction with its idealized notions of the Old South, through the various movements centered around Vanderbilt Universitythe Fugitives, the Agrarians and the New Criticismall of which contributed greatly to the mid-century ""Southern Renaissance,"" and beyond to a broad discussion of postmodern and contemporary writers. Special attention is given to major writers such as Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Shelby Foote and Robert Penn Warren, whom Bryant designates as ""the supreme summary figure of the century,"" but the book also incorporates and draws connections between lesser-known writers or those whose one-time significance has since faded. Well organized with subchapters devoted to African American writers, women writers, playwrights, poets and critics, the book includes a good deal of background and biographical information. What the book offers in breadth of scope, however, it lacks in details such as quotations from the literature discussed or Bryant's own insights. Nonetheless, for the reader interested in a bird's-eye view of the major figures and trends in Southern literature, this work will be a welcome resource. (Nov.)

"Rag and Bone Shop of the Heart: A Poetry Anthology","Robert Bly","9780060924201","Robert Bly, James Hillman, and Michael Meade challenge the assumptions of our poetry-deprived society in this powerful collection of more than 400 deeply moving poems from renowned artists including Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes, Theodore Roethke, Rainer Maria Rilke, Marianne Moore, Thomas Wolfe, Czeslaw Milosz, and Henry David Thoreau.Publishers WeeklyIt is hard not to criticize any anthology that is so bent on having a ``purpose.'' To subsume poems under a single theme is always risky, and to enroll them in a cause detracts from their artistic nature. The poets selected here--everyone from Hesiod to Yeats, Li Po to Dickinson--are first-rate, but for that very reason their work is multi-dimensional, thus hardly about, let alone ``for,'' men. The editors have organized the book into subjects such as ``Mother and Great Mother,'' war, father, ``Wildness'' and love. Their introductions to each section too often leap from the reality of men's feelings to abstractions, Jungian archetypes and myths. As advice for reading poems, their observation that ``for men depression is sometimes the entrance to the soul'' hardly seems helpful, and as psychology it comes close to the old masculine cliche that pain is good and one should suffer one's feelings stoically. But even if the anthology is all too manly, it contains many great poems which speak to us all regardless of sex. And, like the men's movement itself, the book bespeaks a genuine interest in overhauling conventional notions about what is masculine. Bly ( Iron John ) is a poet; Hillman ( Re-Visioning Psychology ) is a psychologist; Meade is a scholar of myth. $50,000 ad/promo. (Sept.)","1993","7"
"Who's to Say What's Obscene?: Politics, Culture, and Comedy in America Today","Paul Krassner","9780872865013","Satirical essays by a countercultural icon about the moral obscenity of contemporary politics, culture, and comedy.Publishers WeeklyKrassner (Confessions of a Raving Unconfined Nut), publisher of the Realist magazine, ruminates on American social and political hypocrisy in these essays that drift between current events and the heyday of the 1960s counterculture when the author dropped acid with the Merry Pranksters and palled around with Abbie Hoffman. Krassner weighs in on the last election cycle, the decriminalization of marijuana, and racism, with a stated (and largely achieved) goal of illuminating the gulf between what society says and what it does. The essays focus mostly on other humorists, and while he points out that today ""sarcasm passes for irony,"" he's far from a curmudgeon and praises such current comics as Sacha Baron Cohen and Sarah Silverman. Krassner says, ""It doesn't have to get a belly laugh, it just has to be valid criticism, which is the classic definition of satire,"" and while this book lingers too long on nostalgic remembrances and tackles serious issues too directly to get constant laughs, it makes a convincing case for the importance-and political necessity-of irreverence.

"New York Stories: The Best Writing from Four Decades of New York Magazine","Steve Fishman","9780812979923","The magazine that is the city that is the worldJust in time for its fortieth anniversary, New York magazine presents a stunning collection of some of its best and most influential articles, stories that captured the spectacle, the turbulence, and the cultural realignments of the past four decades.Covering subjects from “Radical Chic” to Gawker.com, written by some of the country’s most renowned authors, here are works that broke news, perfectly captured the moment, or set trends in motion. In New York Stories, Gloria Steinem (whose Ms. Magazine was introduced in New York) broaches the subject of women’s liberation; Tom Wolfe coins “The Me Decade”; and Steve Fishman piercingly portrays the unwanted martyrdom of the 9/11 widows. Cutting edge features that invented terms like “brat pack” and “grup”; profiles of defining cultural figures including Joe Namath, Truman Capote, and long-shot presidential candidate Bill Clinton; and reports that inspired the acclaimed movies Saturday Night Fever, GoodFellas, and Grey Gardens–all are included in this one-of-a-kind compilation.The writers who chronicled the times that began with Nixon’s campaign and end with Obama’s are at their best in New York Stories. It’s an irresistible anthology from a magazine that, like the city itself, is still making stars, setting standards, and going strong.Publishers WeeklyIn a delightful foreword, Tom Wolfe hits the ground running with a chronicle of New York Magazine's humble beginnings, as a supplement to The New York Herald Tribune, and its growth, at the hands of fearless editor Clay Felker, to rival the untouchable New Yorker. For the mag's 40th anniversary, the editors have collected some of its most memorable essays, including Mark Jacobsen's 1975 ""Night-Shifting for the Hip Fleet"" (which loosely inspired the television show Taxi, Nik Cohn's Tribal Rights of the New Saturday Night and, in turn, the film Saturday Night Fever), two Gloria Steinem essays (including her brilliant 1969 manifesto, ""After Black Power, Women's Lib""), and other articles from the likes of Jay McInerney, George Plimpton, Nora Ephron, Joe Klein, and current New York regulars Kurt Anderson and Emily Nussbaum. More recent favorites include Steve Fishman's ""The Dead Wives Club, or Char in Love,"" about a group profile of Staten Island firemen's wives widowed on 9/11, and Mark Jacobson's ""The $2,000-an-Hour Woman,"" a 2005 piece on ""America's No. 1 escort"" (whose colleague would later bring down Gov. Eliot Spitzer). Highlights abound, including Wolfe's classic 1976 ""The 'Me' Decade,"" which details the yuppy phenomenon's ""great religious wave"" of narcissistic self-discovery for ""dreary little bastards"" with money.

McClatchy","9781400030934","Dazzling in its range, exhilarating in its immediacy and grace, this collection gathers together, from every region of the country and from the past forty years, the poems that continue to shape our imaginations. From Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop, John Ashbery and Adrienne Rich, to Robert Haas and Louise Gluck, this anthology takes the full measure of our poetry's daring energies and its tender understandings.Publishers WeeklyPoetry devotees will be familiar with much of the work in this fine collection, which focuses on the period from WW II until the present. Sixty-five poets, including such well-known writers as Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Theodore Roethke, Anne Sexton, James Dickey, Denise Levertov and Gary Snyder, are represented by anywhere from one to a dozen poems each, as well as a brief biography that touches on the writer's aesthetic ideas. McClatchy, himself a poet and critic, has done an exceptional job of selecting works that typify the poets' styles and beliefs. Standouts are Elizabeth Bishop's ``In the Waiting Room,'' about the poet's first perception of herself in relation to others; Randall Jarrell's ``The Woman at the Washington Zoo,'' which deals with the dull, emotionless routine of modern life; Frank O'Hara's ``Having a Coke with You,'' a dizzy declaration of love during a visit to a New York museum; and Mark Strand's ``Keeping Things Whole,'' in which the poet sees his presence in the world as subtracting from the whole of reality. Unfortunately, the poems are not dated, giving the reader no sense of the writers' chronological development. (Nov.)","2003","0"

"American Earth: Environmental Writing Since Thoreau","Bill McKibben","9781598530209","As America and the world grapple with the consequences of global environmental change, writer and activist Bill McKibben offers this unprecedented, provocative, and timely anthology, gathering the best and most significant American environmental writing from the last two centuries. Classics of the environmental imaginationthe essays of Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, and John Burroughs; Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac; Rachel Carson's Silent Springare set against the inspiring story of an emerging activist movement, as revealed by newly uncovered reports of pioneering campaigns for conservation, passages from landmark legal opinions and legislation, and searing protest speeches. Here are some of America's greatest and most impassioned writers, taking a turn toward nature and recognizing the fragility of our situation on earth and the urgency of the search for a sustainable way of life. Thought-provoking essays on overpopulation, consumerism, energy policy, and the nature of “nature” join ecologists' memoirs and intimate sketches of the habitats of endangered species. The anthology includes a detailed chronology of the environmental movement and American environmental history, as well as an 80-page color portfolio of illustrations.The Washington Post - Gregory McNameeWhat truly sets the anthology apart is not the mix of the obscure and the familiar but McKibben's habit of enlisting voices whom we are not accustomed to thinking of as environmentalists or ecologists. I'd be willing to bet that this is the first work of nature writing to feature the drawings of R. Crumb, of Zap Comix fame, alongside lyrics by Marvin Gaye…Well selected, full of surprises and informed by McKibben's thoughtful commentary, American Earth is the first anthology of American nature writing to come close to the standard Thomas Lyon set two decades ago with ""This Incomperable Lande"": A Book of American Nature Writing. Ours is an incomparable land indeed, and McKibben's collection is a welcome reminder.","2008","3"

This is particularly true when the definition of what constitutes nature writing is limited to work about the pastoral or the wild.Camille T. Dungy has selected 180 poems from 93 poets that provide unique perspectives on American social and literary history to broaden our concept of nature poetry and African American poetics.

It includes selections from Anne Bradstreet, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, e. e. cummings, Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, and Gertrude Stein, as well as significant works of lesser-known American poets.From the Revolutionary and Civil Wars to the Romantic Era and the Gilded and Modern Ages, this unrivaled anthology also presents a memorable array of rare ballads, songs, hymns, spirituals, and carols that echo through our nation's history. Highlights include Native American poems, African American writings, and the works of Quakers, colonists, Huguenots, transcendentalists, scholars, slaves, politicians, journalists, and clergymen.These discerning selections demonstrate that the American canon of poetry is as diverse as the nation itself, and constantly evolving as we pass through time. Most important, this collection strongly reflects the peerless stylings that mark the American poetic experience as unique. Here, in one distinguished volume, are the many voices of the New World.Library JournalIn the exceedingly brief, almost offhand introduction to this chunky anthology, the editors assert that ""there ain't no canon,"" and that their aim is to hold out ""an invitation to the reader of today and to those poets whose names we do not yet know."" Such sloppy vagaries aside, one assumes that their intent is to represent diversity of a sort, but in fact two-thirds of the volume is made up of 19th-century poetry covered far more thoroughly in the Library of America's American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century (LJ 9/1/93), and no rationale is given for the rather strange cut-off date of 1923--unless it has something to do with copyright. There are the usual heavy doses of Whitman, Dickinson, and Stevens, a smattering of spirituals, popular song lyrics, and Native American poems, along with an occasional dash of obscure names such as Ellen Sturgis Hooper and Lucretia Davidson.

The dramatic rise and consolidation of America’s prison system has devastated lives and communities. But it has also transformed prisons into primary sites of radical political discourse and resistance as they have become home to a growing number of writers, activists, poets, educators, and other intellectuals who offer radical critiques of American society both within and beyond the prison walls.&nbsp;In Forced Passages, Dylan Rodríguez argues that the cultural production of such imprisoned intellectuals as Mumia Abu-Jamal, Angela Davis, Leonard Peltier, George Jackson, José Solis Jordan, Ramsey Muniz, Viet Mike Ngo, and Marilyn Buck should be understood as a social and intellectual movement in and of itself, unique in context and substance. Rodríguez engages with a wide range of texts, including correspondence, memoirs, essays, poetry, communiqués, visual art, and legal writing, drawing on published works by widely recognized figures and by individuals outside the public’s field of political vision or concern. Throughout, Rodríguez focuses on the conditions under which imprisoned intellectuals live and work, and he explores how incarceration shapes the ways in which insurgent knowledge is created, disseminated, and received.&nbsp;More than a series of close readings of prison literature, Forced Passages identifies and traces the discrete lineage of radical prison thought since the 1970s, one formed by the logic of state violence and by the endemic racism of thecriminal justice system.&nbsp;Dylan Rodríguez is assistant professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Riverside.","2006","9"

"Tales for Little Rebels: A Collection of Radical Children's Literature","Philip Nel","9780814757215","In 1912, a revolutionary chick cries, ""Strike down the wall!"" and liberates itself from the ""egg state."" In 1940, ostriches pull their heads out of the sand and unite to fight fascism. In 1972, Baby X grows up without a gender and is happy about it.Rather than teaching children to obey authority, to conform, or to seek redemption through prayer, twentieth-century leftists encouraged children to question the authority of those in power. Tales for Little Rebels collects forty-three mostly out-of-print stories, poems, comic strips, primers, and other texts for children that embody this radical tradition. These pieces reflect the concerns of twentieth-century leftist movements, like peace, civil rights, gender equality, environmental responsibility, and the dignity of labor. They also address the means of achieving these ideals, including taking collective action, developing critical thinking skills, and harnessing the liberating power of the imagination.Some of the authors and illustrators are familiar, including Lucille Clifton, Syd Hoff, Langston Hughes, Walt Kelly, Norma Klein, Munro Leaf, Julius Lester, Eve Merriam, Charlotte Pomerantz, Carl Sandburg, and Dr. Seuss. Others are relatively unknown today, but their work deserves to be remembered. (Each of the pieces includes an introduction and a biographical sketch of the author.) From the anti-advertising message of Johnny Get Your Money’s Worth (and Jane Too)! (1938) to the entertaining lessons in ecology provided by The Day They Parachuted Cats on Borneo (1971), and Sandburg’s mockery of war in Rootabaga Pigeons (1923), these pieces will thrill readersintrigued by politics and history  and anyone with a love of children's literature, no matter what age.","2010","6"

"The Best American Sports Writing 2008","William Nack","9780618751181","In this exciting new collection, William Nack, veteran sportswriter and author of the classic Secretariat, honors the year s finest sports journalism and thus upholds the tradition that began seventeen years ago, with David Halberstam at the helm. In these pages, you will find the most provocative, compelling, tragic, and triumphant moments in sports from 2007, captured by the knights of the keyboard who make sports come alive for us day after day, week after week, year after year. Here you ll find Paul Solotaroff s excellent and uncompromising take on the neglect that a growing number of crippled NFL players continually face from the NFL players union. Jeanne Marie Laskas s G-L-O-R-Y! offers a rousing inside look at the pregame rituals of the Cincinnati Bengals cheerleaders. A riveting online diary by Wright Thompson reveals a bleak and merciless landscape in China, which that country s government would rather not have the world see during preparations for the Olympics. Nack finds a place for the fascinating offbeat story as well as the sensational. Alongside Eli Saslow s captivating article about an obscure seventeenth-century sport, similar to a giant rugby scrum, carried out in the streets of Kirkwall, Scotland, stands Franz Lidz s scoop of the year, a controversial and rare look into the life of George Steinbrenner, baseball s largest but recently most enigmatic figure. This year s collection marks another wonderful addition to one of the most consistently satisfying titles in the Best American series (Booklist).

"Coming of Age in America: A Multicultural Anthology","Mary Frosch","9781565841475","The acne and ecstasy of adolescence, a multicultural collection of short stories and fiction excerpts that Library Journal calls ""wonderfully diverse from the standard fare.""By turns touching and hilarious, the classic Coming of Age in America gathers together writers from fifteen different ethnic groups who, through their fiction, explore the terrain we all traverse as we come of age, no matter our race, ethnicity, gender, or class.With over twenty short stories and fiction excerpts by noted authors such as Julia Alvarez and Frank Chin, Dorothy Allison and Adam Schwartz, Reginald McNight and Tobias Wolff, Coming of Age in America shows that our common experiences are more binding than our differences are divisive. Since its initial publication in 1994, Coming of Age in America has evolved from a groundbreaking collection of underrepresented voices into a timeless album of unforgettable literature. Its editor, Mary Frosch, has since created a series of celebrated anthologies, including Coming of Age Around the World and the forthcoming Coming of Age in the 21st Century. A wonderfully readable collection, this is a marvelous resource for those looking for stories that illustrate the convergence of cultural experience and literature.Library JournalThe 20-odd short stories and novel excerpts comprising this book are all previously published works, several from critically acclaimed authors like Tobias Wolff, Paule Marshall, and National Book Award finalist Dorothy Allison. Evocative of triumphs and tribulations we all experience during adolescence, this anthology shares needed perspectives that are wonderfully diverse from the standard fare that young adults are most often encouraged to digest. For a tiny, tempting sampling, try this beautiful description from ``Marigolds,'' Eugenia Collier's award-winning story: ``Memory is an abstract painting-it does not present things as they are but rather as they feel.''

"Written by Herself: Autobiographies of American Women","Jill Ker Conway","9780679736332","The bestselling author of The Road from Coorain presents an extraordinarily powerful anthology of the autobiographical writings of 25 women, literary predecessors and contemporaries that include Jane Addams, Zora Neale Hurst, Harriet Jacobs, Ellen Glasgow, Maya Angelou, Sara Josephine Baker, Margaret Mead, Gloria Steinem, and Maxine Hong Kingston.Library JournalThe autobiographies in this collection are by women of extraordinary achievement--some well known, some neglected through the generations--who overcame daunting obstacles to pursue their individual destinies in an often hostile, changing America. The narratives, chosen and edited by historian Conway, a former president of Smith College, are grouped into the areas of freedom-fighting, science, arts and letters, and social reform. Among the women relaying their encounters with discrimination are Marian Anderson, preeminent black contralto, who was celebrated in Europe but barred from appearing at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., and Margaret Mead, the renowned anthropologist, who refused a ``safe'' field assignment and forged her own way in Samoa. Many, like writer Zora Neale Hurston, emerged from broken or impoverished families to pursue an education and find a way to support themselves and their families. The strong, clear voices of the trailblazers found in this exemplary anthology reveal a sheer delight in excellence, adventure, and intellectual challenge.

"The Best American Essays of the Century","Joyce Carol Oates","9780618155873","This singular collection is nothing less than a political, spiritual, and intensely personal record of America’s tumultuous modern age, as experienced by our foremost critics, commentators, activists, and artists. Joyce Carol Oates has collected a group of works that are both intimate and important, essays that move from personal experience to larger significance without severing the connection between speaker and audience. From Ernest Hemingway covering bullfights in Pamplona to Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Letter from Birmingham Jail,” these essays fit, in the words of Joyce Carol Oates, into a kind of mobile mosaic suggest[ing] where we’ve come from, and who we are, and where we are going.” Among those whose work is included are Mark Twain, John Muir, T. S. Eliot, Richard Wright, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin, Tom Wolfe, Susan Sontag, Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, Joan Didion, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Stephen Jay Gould, Edward Hoagland, and Annie Dillard.Publishers Weekly""Here is a history of America told in many voices,"" declares Oates in her introduction, revealing the heart of her intelligent and incisive collection of 55 essays by American writers. Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic ""American identity,"" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it's not explicitly political, the volume's multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with ""Cone-pone Opinions,"" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that ""America"" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois's ""Of the Coming of John,"" James Baldwin's ""Notes of a Native Son"" and Mary McCarthy's ""Artists in Uniform"" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot's ""Tradition and the Individual Talent."" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich's meditation on pastoral aesthetics in ""The Solace of Open Spaces"" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag's urban-centered ""Notes on Camp."" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities.

This daring new fiction, often innovative in form and courageous in its candid representations of female sexuality, marital discontent, and feminist protest, shocked Victorian critics, who denounced the authors as ""literary degenerates"" or ""erotomaniacs.""This collection brings together twenty of the most original and important stories from this period. The writers included in this highly readable volume are Kate Chopin, Victoria Cross, George Egerton, Julia Constance Fletcher, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Sarah Grand, Vernon Lee, Ada Leverson, Charlotte Mew, Olive Schreiner, Edith Wharton, Constance Fenimore Woolson, and Mabel E.

She is the author of A Literature of Their Own, The Female Malady, and other books, and editor of Alternative Alcott, a volume in the American Women Writers Series (Rutgers University Press).Publishers WeeklyWexelblatt ( Life in the Temperate Zone and Other Stories ) constructs rich stories that make heavy subjects dance weightlessly before the reader's eyes. In one tale, a writer who believes that under repressive regimes ``art becomes . . . political against its will'' gets a chance to live out the plot of a story he sketched when he suddenly becomes president of the republic. The nature of historical truth is considered when a professor replies to a graduate student who is trying to ``cope'' with history: he interprets the story of ``The Savior, Ishl Teitelbaum,'' a Jew in a concentration camp who listens to a rabbi and a political ideologue debate the meaning of the Holocaust-- and is then gassed. A 92-year-old nursing home resident reflects on his days as a member of an artists' collaborative that challenged accepted notions of individuality and creativity. Even tales that at first seem conventional become luminescent and unsettling, as in the story of a writer who recalls a Saturday afternoon of games with friends when he was 10; the narrative is interrupted by a dialogue between the author and an inquisitor that explores memory, truth and the knowledge of death.

"Transforming a Rape Culture","Emilie Buchwald","9781571312693","Originally published in 1993, this pioneering anthology is a powerful polemic for fundamental cultural change: the transformation of basic attitudes about power, gender, race, and sexuality. This edition adds new pieces on Internet pornography, the role of sports in sexual violence, and rape as a calculated instrument of war. The diverse contributors, which include bell hooks, Andrea Dworkin, Michael Messner, Yvette Flores, and Ntozake Shange, are activists, opinion leaders, theologians, policymakers, educators, and authors of both genders who tackle such hot-button issues as pornography and the intersection of race and rape. The book's statistics have been thoroughly updated, as have essays about sexual violence in K-12 schools and in the church. New pieces from within America's immigrant communities depict struggles with domestic violence, sexual harassment, and community stigmas against reporting rape. This violence, not limited to one race, creed, or nationality, has its roots in cultural biases that are still much in need of change.Publishers WeeklyThe contributors to this invaluable sourcebook share the conviction that rape is epidemic because our society encourages male aggression and tacitly or overtly supports violence against women. Cumulatively, these 34 essays by such figures as Gloria Steinem, Andrea Dworkin, Ntozake Shange, Michael Kimmel and Louise Erdrich situate rape on a continuum extending from sexist language to pornography, sexual harassment in schools and the workplace, wife battering and date and marital rape. Most of the selections were written for this volume. Highlights include a proposal to make rape a presidential election issue, an analysis of the churches' ambivalent response to societal violence, guidelines for raising boys to view themselves as nurturing, nonviolent fathers and inspirational visions of personal or institutional change. Buchwald is publisher/editor of Milkweed, Fletcher an English professor at North Hennepin Community College in Minnesota and Roth edits the feminist quarterly, Hurricane Alice. (Oct.)","2004","9"
"Death Blossoms: Reflections from a Prisoner of Conscience","Mumia Abu-Jamal","9780896086999","Mumia's Abu-Jamal's poetic observations and reflections examine the deeper dimensions of existence, resulting in a powerful testament to the human spirit.Library JournalIt is impossible to escape the irony that a man so impassioned about life has spent the last 15 years on death row. A journalist (Live from Death Row, LJ 5/1/95) and self-described ""professional revolutionary"" accused of killing a Philadelphia police officer, Abu-Jamal has won international attention for his case. Prison walls, however, have done little to deter his activism. His latest book has a markedly spiritual undertone, as he discusses his views on religion and fellow inmates' thoughts on the subject. In this compilation of over 35 short commentaries and poems, the author questions the validity of Christianity and traces his struggles with religion. In one touching essay, he compares children to acorns, saying that they possess the power to grow into mighty oak trees. Abu-Jamal's words flow like the very sap of those trees, pulsing with energy and capturing the essence of life.

The line-up of contributing authors includes Francine Prose, Kevin Baker, Jonathan Rosen, Laura Shaine Cunningham, Christopher Sorrentino, Suketu Mehta, and Nathaniel Rich. The pulse of a great city in sculpted prose.Publishers WeeklyFor 16 years, local news and quirky, personal stories found a home in the (now defunct) City section of the Sunday New York Times.

Tragedies--like the story of giving a homeless man buried in the city's potter's field a proper family funeral--are squeezed like subway passengers between droller accounts of, say, the weekly lunch ritual of the New Yorker's wry cartoonists.

"Queer Beats: How the Beats Turned America On to Sex","Regina Marler","9781573441889","Among the unconventional attitudes of the Beat writers as they rebelled against the conformism of the late 1940s and 1950s was their relaxed stance on sexuality. At a time when gay people were considered mentally ill or criminal, the Beats celebrated spontaneity and freedom in thought, word, and action. They were queer in the fullest sense of the word: their fluid sexuality challenged all sexual and romantic conventions. Combining fiction, letters, and poetry, Queer Beats explores the sexual pulse that throbbed throughout the Beats' writings - from the perverse ""cut-up"" prose of William S. Burroughs's Naked Lunch and the homoerotic poetry of Allen Ginsberg to Jack Kerouac's letter to Neal Cassady in which he declares (despite sexual encounters with Ginsberg and Gore Vidal): ""Posterity will laugh at me if it thinks I was queer.""

"Imagination And Spirit","J. Brent Bill","9780944350614","From essays about the Quaker Christian experience and the ""mystery at the core of all being"" to a murder mystery by Irene Allen, this collection presents some of the best of contemporary Quaker nonfiction and fiction writing, with a brief biography of each author. Among these popular 20th- and 21st-century writers are names familiar to readers of mainstream Christianity, including Thomas Kelly, Jessamyn West, James Michener, Daisy Newman, Jan de Hartog, and Scott Russell Sanders. These adept essays and works of fiction reflect the true scope of spiritual experience, offering essays and fiction that range from t&lt;%END%&gt;er, thought-provoking, and challenging to humorous, dramatic, and mysterious.Author Biography: J. Brent Bill is the associate director of the Indianapolis Center for Congregations. He is the assistant book review editor for Fri&lt;%END%&gt;s Journal and director of the Ministry of Writing Annual Colloquium at Earlham School of Religion. He lives in Plainfield, Indiana.Publishers WeeklyIt's high time the traditional Publishers of Truth as Quakers originally called themselves published something for today's general readers outside the Quaker fold. Bill's anthology picks up where the Quaker Reader (edited by novelist Jessamyn West) left, focusing on writings from the latter half of the 20th century. The prose mix is lively: nonfiction devotional slices from modern mystic Thomas Kelly are served up along with such fiction as an excerpt from the murder mystery Quaker Testimony by Irene Allen, pen name for geologist Elsa Kirsten Peters. Such dizzying range makes the point that contemporary Quakers liberal, pastoral, evangelical can be mildly or wildly different despite common core beliefs in peace, simplicity, truth telling and ongoing divine revelation. At the same time it offers excerpts from such better known Quaker believers as James Michener and Richard Foster, the anthology introduces such unsung writers as children's book specialist Elfrida Vipont Foulds, one of a notably large cadre of women who have always been empowered in Quaker tradition to speak or write. Anthologies are necessarily arbitrary, acknowledges editor Bill, an Earlham College writing program graduate who provides helpful biographical introductions. Still, the influential writer-educator Parker Palmer should have been included. However, this collection is a welcome reminder that the small Society of Friends, as Quakers are also known, continues to offer creative and relevant witness to the truth as found within and practiced in community.

"True Crime: An American Anthology","Harold Schechter","9781598530315","Americans have had an uneasy fascination with crime since the earliest European settlements in the New World, and right from the start true crime writing became a dominant genre in American writing. True Crime: An American Anthology offers the first comprehensive look at the many ways in which American writers have explored crime in a multitude of aspects: the dark motives that spur it, the shock of its impact on society, the effort to make sense of the violent extremes of human behavior. Here is the full spectrum of the true crime genre, including accounts of some of the most notorious criminal cases in American history: the Helen Jewett murder and the once-notorious “Kentucky tragedy” of the 1830s, the assassination of President Garfield, the Snyder- Gray murder that inspired Double Indemnity, the Lindbergh kidnapping, the Black Dahlia, Leopold and Loeb, and the Manson family. True Crime draws upon the writing of literary figures as diverse as Nathaniel Hawthorne (reporting on a visit to a waxworks exhibit of notorious crimes), Ambrose Bierce, Mark Twain, Theodore Dreiser (offering his views on a 1934 murder that some saw as a “copycat” version of An American Tragedy), James Thurber, Joseph Mitchell, and Truman Capote and sources as varied as execution sermons, murder ballads, early broadsides and trial reports, and tabloid journalism of many different eras. It also features the influential true crime writing of best-selling contemporary practitioners like James Ellroy, Gay Talese, Dominick Dunne, and Ann Rule.The Barnes &amp; Noble ReviewIf people read detective fiction to see justice done, they read true crime stories in order to see innocence lost. From Edgar Allan Poe (who invented the detective genre) to Arthur Conan Doyle (whose Sherlock Holmes proved its greatest popularizer) through to today's assortment of imaginary private and public investigators, fictional detective stories center on the heroic ingenuity of the detective, whose guts, guile, and guiding intelligence result in a solution that is -- for entertainment's sake -- typically counterintuitive and unpredictable. The detective outwits the criminal and justice is served.","2008","3"

Their cure is this collection of bite-size prose and poetry by contemporary Western women telling personal stories about their connections to the West and the rest of the world. It's a tribute to the ordinary and the unconventional ways that women have shaped and sustained communities and contributed (often silently and namelessly) to the legacy of the West.

Themes emerge throughout the collection-how women minister to one another with food and a helping hand, how laughter heals and protects, and how vitally important relationships are to women, especially to those living in remote areas.

In a moment of inspiration that has been much-welcomed ever since by caregivers the world over, the idea for A Loving Voice came to it's editors, Carolyn Banks and Janis Rizzo, when they recognized the desperate need for, and the serious lack of, reading material for this large and ever-growing segment of the population. In response, they invited hundreds of writers to submit stories and poems for their anthology. The 52 never-before-published selections they ended up including (43 stories and nine poems, one for each week of the year), are those that they and the eldercare experts they consulted felt would be most valuable and entertaining for their elderly audience: stories that evoke nostalgic memories and warm feelings of the past, interesting stories that stimulate conversation, provide a bridge between the past and present and a bond between reader and listener. All of the selections can be read in one sitting (no longer than 10 minutes), are clear with easy-to-follow plots and simple dialogue that lends itself to reading aloud. Moreover, as Banks and Rizzo discovered, reading aloud is an intimate, warm and friendly activity that encourages physical closeness, something that is sorely needed as we age. As Carolyn Banksreports in preface to the book, ""The pieces we have chosen are not insultingly simple. Even those who are able to read these selections on their own will find them engaging and entertaining. These are stories and poems with purpose, stories and poems with heart, stories and poems we are proud to present. Each we hope will help you find your own loving voice.""Includes short stories and poems written by an impressive array of American authors including Louise Erdrich, Shelby Hearon, Carolyn Osborn and Paul Estaver. This book, and it's accompanying second volume, A Loving Voice II: A Caregiver's Book of More Read-Aloud Stories for the Elderly, has received critical acclaim from professional caregivers and grateful family members alike and has been enthusiastically reviewed in hundreds of papers, magazines and journals alike for its inventive method of communicating with, and bringing some moments of pleasure to, the older adult.","1992","7"

"American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century (Melville to Stickney, American Indian Poetry, Folk Songs and Spirituals) (Library of America), Vol. 2","Various","9780940450783","In nineteenth-century America, poetry was, part of everyday life, as familiar as a hymn, a love song, a patriotic exhortation. American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century reveals the vigor and diversity of a tradition embracing solitary visionaries and congenial storytellers, humorists and dissidents, songwriters and philosophers. These two volumes reassess America's poetic legacy with a comprehensive sweep that no previous anthology has attempted. This second volume follows the evolution of American poetry from the monumental mid-century achievements of Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson to the modernist stirrings of Stephen Crane and Edwin Arlington Robinson. The cataclysm of the Civil War - reflected in fervent antislavery protests, in marching songs and poetic calls to arms, and in muted postbellum expressions of grief and reconciliation - ushered in a period of accelerating change and widening regional perspectives. Among the unfamiliar pleasures to be savored in this volume are the penetrating meditations of the reclusive Frederick Goddard Tuckerman, the eloquent lyricism of Emma Lazarus, the mournful, superbly crafted fin de siecle verse of Trumbull Stickney. Here too are the pioneering African-American poets (Frances Harper, Albery Allson Whitman, Paul Laurence Dunbar); popular humorists (James Whitcomb Riley, Eugene Field); writers embodying America's newfound cosmopolitanism (Edith Wharton, George Santayana); and extravagant self-mythologizing figures who could have existed nowhere else, like the actress Adah Isaacs Menken and the frontier poet Joaquin Miller. Parodies, dialect poems, song lyrics, and children's verse evoke the liveliness of an era when poetry was accessible to all. Here are poems that played a crucial role in American public life, whether to arouse the national conscience (Edwin Markham's ""The Man with the Hoe"") or to memorialize the golden age of the national pastime (Ernest Lawrence Thayer's ""Casey at the Bat""). An entire section of tLibrary JournalIn size and ambition, this may be the largest selection of poetry from our nation's first full century since Edmund Stedman's An American Anthology, 1787-1900, published more than 90 years ago. With its special sections of Native American poems, African American spirituals and hymns, folksongs, and popular or patriotic verses (e.g., ``Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' ``Home, Sweet Home!'' and Stephen Foster's lyrics), the present volume evokes an era when poetry was enjoyed more than studied, written out of the desire for self-expression rather than the need for tenure. Major poets like Dickinson and Whitman are amply represented, but the collection also allows readers to rediscover the graceful strength of Sarah Orne Jewett, Ella Wilcox's nearly modernist irony, the Goreyesque eccentricity of Ambrose Bierce, and president John Quincy Adams's way with ballad meter. Arrangement is chronological by poet's date of birth; the accompanying biographical sketches, a chronology, notes, and an essay on textual selection were not available for review. Though Hollander's selections will inspire much debate, this anthology is a necessary addition to most library shelves.-- Fred Muratori, Cornell Univ. Lib., Ithaca, N.Y.","1993","5"

"The Jazz Poetry Anthology","Sascha Feinstein","9780253206374","""... in a class by itself... sensitive, moving, and powerful jazz imagery... the perfect companion to listening to good jazz.""  Jazziz Magazine""In the course of the history of jazz, there have been only a few articles that get to the core of the meaning of jazz.

Its virtues are varied and copious, and not the least among them is discovering a writer whose work is new to you.""  Los Angeles Reader""What makes this work most enjoyable is knowing the music and musicians and using that knowledge to understand and judge the poets' reactions to the elements in the music that please and inspire us.""  MultiCultural Review""Filled with a variety of form, rhythm, and sound, this anthology is an absolute MUST for anyone who is even remotely interested in jazz and modern literature.""  David BakerSince the turn of the century, poets have responded to jazz in all its musical and cultural overtones. The poems here cover the range of jazz itself: from early blues to free jazz and experimental music. Among the 132 poets included are James Baldwin, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Langston Hughes, Jack Kerouac, Mina Loy, Ishmael Reed, and Sonia Sanchez. This anthology represents the broad appreciation for jazz as poetic inspiration, not only from the Beat movement but from writers across the decades and around the world.Library JournalWhile individual poets have often been linked to jazz, this music's influence on 20th-century writing has rarely been seen in perspective. Unfortunately, this first large-scale international attempt to explore the relationship between the two forms disappoints. Some 132 poets are arranged alphabetically. Among them are Sterling A. Brown, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Langston Hughes, Carl Sandburg, and Leopold Senghor. The selection, however, is both too inclusive and too diverse. Dana Goia describes Bix Beiderbecke, but his stilted lines conflict with the music's rhythms; Heather McHugh's formal approach feels equally superficial. Individual poems seldom interact to form a larger statement; the ``music appendix,'' historically situating these selections, might have been a better organizational device. The statement of poetics, gathered from less than half the poets, are this volume's most valuable asset.-- Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, ``Soho Weekly News,'' New York","1991","5"
"The Oxford Book of American Short Stories","Joyce Carol Oates","9780195092622","""How ironic,"" Joyce Carol Oates writes in her introduction to this marvelous collection, ""that in our age of rapid mass-production and the easy proliferation of consumer products, the richness and diversity of the American literary imagination should be so misrepresented in most anthologies."" Why, she asks, when writers such as Samuel Clemens, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Saul Bellow, and John Updike have among them written hundreds of short stories, do anthologists settle on the same two or three titles by each author again and again? ""Isn't the implicit promise of an anthology that it will, or aspires to, present something different, unexpected?"" In The Oxford Book of American Short Stories, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of fifty-six tales that combines classic works with many ""different, unexpected"" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers. Some selections simply can't be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving's ""Rip Van Winkle,"" Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" and Hemingway's ""A Clean, Well-Lighted Place."" But alongside these classics, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain's ""Cannibalism in the Cars,"" a story that reveals a darker side to his humor (""That morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to...a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy""). From Melville come the juxtaposed tales ""The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,"" of which Oates says, ""Only Melville could have fashioned out of 'real' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction."" From Flannery O'Connor we find ""A Late Encounter With the Enemy,"" and from John Cheever, ""The Death of Justina,"" one of Cheever's own favorites, though rarely anthologized. The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston. Contemporary artists abound, including Bharati Mukherjee and Amy Tan, Alice Adams and David Leavitt, Bobbie Ann Mason and Tim O'Brien, Louise Erdrich and John Edgar Wideman. Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work, plus a long introductory essay, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master. This then is a book of surprises, a fascinating portrait of American short fiction, as filtered through the sensibility of a major modern writer.Library JournalIn these lean times, it is difficult to imagine many libraries champing at the bit to purchase yet another anthology of American short stories. But institutions seeking to expand the diversity of their holdings in this area may find this collection the perfect choice. ``Familiar names, unfamiliar titles'' is the raison d'etre for this new volume. Along with some old chestnuts such as ``The Tell-Tale Heart'' and ``A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,'' editor Oates presents many fresh selections such as Edith Wharton's ``The Journey'' and John Cheever's ``The Death of Justina.'' She includes lesser-known minority and women writers such as Jean Toomer and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman alongside stories by newcomers Amy Tan, Louise Erdrich, and David Leavitt. Each author is given a brief biographical introduction. Recommended for serious literary collections.-- Rita Ciresi, Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park","1994","3"

"American Political Plays after 9/11","Allan Havis","9780809329540","American Political Plays after 9/11 is a diverse collection of bold, urgent, and provocative plays that respond to the highly charged, post 9/11 political landscape. Sparked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequently fueled by a series of controversial events—the Iraq war, the passing and enforcement of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, and the revelation of torture and other scandals at the Abu Ghraib prison—American political theater is currently experiencing a surge in activity. The plays in this collection include The Guys by Anne Nelson, At the Vanishing Point by Naomi Iizuka, The Venus de Milo Is Armed by Kia Corthron, Back of the Throat by Yusseff El Guindi, Three Nights in Prague by Allan Havis, and Question 27, Question 28 by Chay Yew. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The characters range from a New York City fire captain trying to respectfully memorialize eight of his lost comrades, to the citizens of a hog-killing Louisville neighborhood who poignantly exemplify the underside of the economic crisis, to an Arab American citizen being harshly (and possibly unfairly) interrogated by two officers as a “person of interest.” Though not all of the plays deal explicitly with the Al Qaeda attacks, they collectively reveal themes of sorrow and anxiety, moral indignation, alarmist self-preservation, and economic and social insecurity stemming from the United States’ fairly sudden shift from cold war superpower to vulnerable target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lively introduction by Allan Havis includes a brief history of political theater in the United States, an extensive discussion about how theater communities responded to 9/11, and an informative analysis of the six plays in the book.&nbsp; A collection of dramatic material framed by this significant historical event, American Political Plays after 9/11 will be indispensable for theater and cultural studies scholars and students.","2010","3"
"Transcendentalism: A Reader","Joel Myerson","9780195122138","The transcendentalist movement is generally recognized to be the first major watershed in American literary and intellectual history. Pioneered by Emerson, Thoreau, Orestes Brownson, Margaret Fuller, and Bronson Alcott (among others), Transcendentalism provided a springboard for the first distinctly American forays into intellectual culture: religion and religious reform, philosophy, literature, ecology, and spiritualism. This new collection, edited by eminent American literature scholar Joel Myerson, is the first anthology of the period to appear in over fifty years. Transcendentalism: A Reader draws together in their entirety the essential writings of the Transcendentalist group during its most active period, 1836-1844. It includes the major publications of the Dial, the writings on democratic and social reform, the early poetry, nature writings, and all of Emerson's major essays, as well as an informative introduction and annotations by Myerson.Library JournalThis magnificent edition of the writings of the Transcendentalists introduces a consequential strain of American thinking to new readers. The works have been sensibly selected, and because the original spelling and punctuation have been preserved, the dazzling originality of thinkers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Louisa May Alcott, Elizabeth Peabody, and Margaret Fuller rises from the pages with the force and agility of a rousing sermon. Myerson (American literature, Univ. of South Carolina) has edited another collection on Transcendentalism and one on Emerson, but this work surpasses both. Here he deftly thumbnails each author's argument and, in an inspired introduction, reminds us that the seeds of much of America's greatest potential--the defiant belief in individual civil rights, justice, and equality--can be found by reading the Transcendentalists in their own words. This indispensable volume is highly recommended.--Ulrich Baer, New York University Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.","2000","3"
"Black on White: Black Writers on What It Means to Be White","David R. Roediger","9780805211146","In this thought-provoking volume, David R. Roediger has brought together some of the most important black writers throughout history to explore the question: What does it really mean to be white in America?From folktales and slave narratives to contemporary essays, poetry, and fiction, black writers have long been among America's keenest students of white consciousness and white behavior, but until now much of this writing has been ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp;Black on White reverses this trend by presenting the work of more than fifty major figures, including James Baldwin, Derrick Bell, Ralph Ellison, W.E.B. Du Bois, bell hooks, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker to take a closer look at the many meanings of whiteness in our society.Rich in irony, artistry, passion, and common sense, these reflections on what Langston Hughes called ""the ways of white folks"" illustrate how whiteness as a racial identity derives its meaning not as a biological category but as a social construct designed to uphold racial inequality. Powerful and compelling, Black on White provides a much-needed perspective that is sure to have a major impact on the study of race and race relations in America.Library JournalThese two books belong to a growing body of work that examines white identity through African American writings. Historian Roediger (Towards the Abolition of Whiteness, Norton, 1994) here collects illuminating views of ""whiteness"" from black writers ranging from such early figures as the revolutionary David Walker to contemporaries like Toni Morrison. Some of the expected sources are here, including James Baldwin's Going To Meet the Man and Richard Wright's Black Boy, but among several delightful surprises are George S. Schuyler's essay ""Our White Folks"" and Alice Walker's ""The Dummy in the Window: Joel Chandler Harris and the Invention of Uncle Remus."" Although the anthology includes a range of perspectives, Roediger has essentially excluded ""the more reflexively antiwhite tradition represented (at times) by the nation of Islam, or by Leonard Jeffries's recent writing on whites."" This results in some notable omissions, including Malcom X. Still, this is a valubable collection that should go a long way in helping us to understand America's troubled racial relations. Recommended for all collections. Sartwell (philosophy, Pennsylvania State Univ.) analyzes the perception of whiteness in the slave narratives of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, and Malcolm X, and contemporary rap music. He contends that whites, in seeking to establish their identity as the norm, ultimately render themselves invisible. Furthermore, white identity is typically constructed in comparison with nonwhite identities, often portraying the latter as inferior, he notes. Through the writings of African Americans, Sartwell believes whiteness can be viewed in a more objective manner. At the same time that he seeks to elucidate the texts, he grapples with his own whiteness. In the process, he has presented an engaging though disturbing investigation of the complex politics of identity. Recommended for academic libraries.Louis J.

One of the strongest debut collections of the '90s.""Publishers WeeklyPublishers WeeklyIn one of the strongest debut collections of the 90s, this black lesbian feminist presents a fusion of poetry and prose, interspersed with short stories. Not for the squeamish, Sapphire's imagery is so fierce that readers will want to spread out the book over several sittings. Accounts of a young girl's rape by her father frame and inform all else, but Sapphire draws in irony as a buffer: in one extremely vivid poem, familiar phrases from the Mickey Mouse Club alternate with memories of assault. Early in her career, this writer felt the need to tell the stories of all victims (Tawana Brawley, the Central Park jogger, a nameless woman she meets on the bus), but to accomplish this she must adopt their emotional horrors as her own. ``Now that you know, / you can begin / to heal,'' the first poem ends. It is this commitment to human sensitivity that makes the terrifying exploits described here palatable. It also permits the narrator, 80 pages later, to describe the grief she feels at her mother's deathbed. Perfectly paced, sidestepping explication, Sapphire's words provide pointers to her characters' dramas, but she's still capable of stunning readers with a final image. (Feb.)","1996","3"

These pieces span the centuries from 1711 to 2003, address topics ranging from religion to HIV and represent prose and poetry, fiction and nonfiction, lullabies and protest songs. Marriage is a theme that runs throughout: ""A Mother's Advice and Prayer"" from 1858 is a nuptial manual in verse, and ""I Want a Divorce,"" taken from a 1922 court record, gives a valuable glimpse of the power struggles between husband and wife. On a lighter note, a collection of recent song lyrics complains about useless husbands and lovers. Many 20th-century writers address colonialism and independence: Penina Muhando Mlama's ""Creating in the Mother-Tongue"" looks at the linguistic, literary and socioeconomic obstacles to writing in indigenous languages.

Culled from an impressive variety of sources and ranging over topics as disparate as Shaker furniture, perfume, and the monastic life, the essays and poems collected here share a search for purpose beyond the mundane -- and find answers in the likeliest and unlikeliest of sources.Here you will find George Packer’s The Moderate Martyr,” a profile of the peaceful Islamic visionary Mahmoud Muhammad Taha, alongside Sridhar Pappu’s report on the Preacher,” Bishop T. D. Jakes, the entrepreneurially inclined leader of one of the largest churches in the country. Garry Wills questions whether it is possible (or even desirable) to live according to the maxim What would Jesus do?” In response to the recent spate of atheist attacks on organized religion, Marilynne Robinson offers an insightful critique of Hysterical Scientism.” Adam Gopnik explores the link between Shaker beliefs and the austere beauty of Shaker creations, and Joseph Epstein muses on the reasons for broken friendships. Some of the essays are deeply personal: Mary Gordon examines her complex relationship with her mother, and Pico Iyer reveals the place where he goes to be himself.Including powerful poetry from notable contributors such as Deborah Digges, Galway Kinnell, and John Updike, and an introduction by Harvey Cox, The Best American Spiritual Writing 2007 is one of those transformative magical books” that Zaleski describes in his foreword, a volume that gracefully probes the role of faith in modern life while offering both spiritual insight and literary excellence.","2007","2"
"I'll Fly Away: Further Testimonies from the Women of York Prison","Wally Lamb","9780061626395","For several years, Wally Lamb, the author of two of the most beloved novels of our time, has run a writing workshop at the York Correctional Institution, Connecticut's only maximum-security prison for women.

"Pioneers of the Black Atlantic: Five Slave Narratives from the Enlightenment, 1772-1815","Henry Louis Gates Jr.","9781887178983","In the eighteenth century, a small group of black men met the challenge of the Enlightenment by mastering the arts and sciences and writing themselves into history. The battle lines were clear—literacy stood as the ultimate measure of humanity to the white arbiters of Western culture. If blacks could succeed in this sphere, they would prove that African and European humanity were inseparable. Without a literary record, blacks seemed predestined for slavery.The small but dedicated group—now known as the Black Atlantic writers—who stepped forward to meet this challenge published their autobiographies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They not only defied the popular opinion of the time that blacks were unfit for letters, but inaugurated the Black American and Black British literary traditions.While slave narratives are often excerpted and anthologized, they are rarely collected in their entirety. Pioneers of the Black Atlantic is the first anthology to include the complete texts of the five most important and influential narratives of the eighteenth century. Included here are the writings of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, John Marrant, Ottobah Cugoano, Olaudah Equiano, and John Jea.Their stories, resonant still in our racially divided world, are landmarks in the history of autobiography and human rights.","1998","2"
"The American Aeneas: Classical Origins of the American Self","John C. Shields","9781572331327","In The American Aeneas, John C. Shields exposes a significant cultural blindness within American consciousness. Noting that the biblical myth of Adam has long dominated ideas of what it means to be American, Shields argues that an equally important component of our nation's cultural identity--a secular one deriving from the classical tradition-has been seriously neglected.  The author finds various Early American texts, including pastorals, pastoral elegies, literary independence poems, tracts on educational theories, religious discourses, and political writings, laden with elements of classicism, particularly the myth of Aeneas as depicted by Vergil. Shields demonstrates that Aeneas, Vergil's hero of the Aeneid, was an especially apt figure for New World discourse in that he epitomized ""the sailor who struck out onto dangerous, uncharted seas in order to discover a new land in which to build a new civilization. ""Shields shows how both the myth of Adam and the myth of Aeneas, in crossing over to America from Europe, dynamically intermingled in the thought of the earliest American writers. This rearticulation of the myths of Adam and Aeneas became peculiarly adapted to the demands of the American adventure in freedom. Shields argues that uncovering and acknowledging the classical roots of our culture can allay the American fear of ""pastlessness"" that the long-standing emphasis on the Adamic myth has generated.  The author's probing analysis sheds new light on the works of such seminal figures as Edward Taylor, Cotton Mather, Phillis Wheatley, George Washington, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville. But it does much more than that--it posits a new model for American studies. ""This model,"" Shields writes, ""is not composed of a single strand which can only direct the struggle to explore the dimensions of American culture in a linear fashion--an inevitable dead end. The image of two strands coming together, intertwining and interconnecting so as to accommodate virtually infinite possibilities, more accurately captures the dynamic of Americanness.""","2001","6"

Major names are well represented, and new voices are also included, which many teachers and students may not have heard of yet, but will appreciate. There is a good balance of men and women, and I was especially impressed with the inclusion of many poets producing work before 1900. What makes special this collection special is the general introduction, along with the biographies that introduce the work of each poet. The introduction articulates clearly the history of African American poetry, and emphasizes the political and historical context of the poems. The editors then use the work of Sterling A. Brown as a model for investigating and understanding the work of each individual poet. Each biography provides basic facts and summary of the work, and also some evaluation of style, topic and form, which will help both students and teachers study and appreciate the poetry. There is no index, but there is an accessible, chronologically arranged table of contents at the beginning and a Selected Bibliographies section at the end. This is a valuable and inexpensive addition to all libraries, which will likely pique the interest of YA poets and non-poets alike.

"Infinite Divisions: An Anthology of Chicana Literature","Tey Diana Rebolledo","9780816513840","Given the explosive creativity shown by Chicana writers over the past two decades, this first major anthology devoted to their work is a major contribution to American letters. It highlights the key issues, motifs, and concerns of Mexican American women from 1848 to the present, and particularly reflects the modern Chicana's struggle for identity. Among the recurring themes in the collection is a re-visioning of foremothers such as the historical Malinche, the mythical Llorona, and pioneering women who settled the American Southwest from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries. Also included are historical documents on the lives, culture, and writings of Mexican American women in the nineteenth century, as well as oral histories recorded by the Federal Writers Project in the 1930s. Through poetry, fiction, drama, essay, and other forms, this landmark volume showcases the talents of more than fifty authors, including Gloria E. Anzaldúa, Ana Castillo, Lorna Dee Cervantes, Denise Chávez, Sandra Cisneros, Pat Mora, Cherríe Moraga, and María Helena Viramontes.Publishers WeeklyRebolledo and Rivera, who teach Spanish at the University of New Mexico, offer an intriguing but ultimately unsatisfying collection of poetry and prose by Mexican-American women. An excellent introduction provides a critical overview and helps put the pieces in their historical and literary context. The works reflect the development of a Chicana consciousness from its first seeds until the present. A section on ``foremothers'' collects oral and written pieces dating back to the 19th century. In one, from 1877, an aged widow recalls the deviously charitable way some priests got her a job. Sandra Cisneros, Alma Villanueva and Gloria Anzaldua provide numerous selections each, as do up-and-coming writers, such as Ines Hernandez or Marina Rivera, who offers a meditation on what it means to be of mixed blood. The title comes from Bernice Zamora's fine Whitmanesque poem about the infinitely divisible nature of identity. The pieces, however, are far too brief; most are mere snippets. Thus the editors merely whet the appetite but fail in their intention to make available hard-to-find Chicana literature. (June)","1993","6"

Yet most women’s stories of personal growth after motherhood tend to remain untold. As writers and mothers, Andrea Buchanan and Amy Hudock were frustrated by what they perceived as a lack of writing by mothers that captured the ambiguity, complexity, and humor of their experiences.

All the icons of this greatest of cities swirl and flash through these pages: taxis and subways, bridges and skyscrapers, ghettos and roof gardens and fire escapes, from the South Bronx to Coney Island to Broadway to Central Park, and from Langston Hughes’s Harlem to James Merrill’s Upper East Side. Wallace Stevens, e. e. cummings, W. H. Auden, Dorothy Parker, Elizabeth Bishop, Allen Ginsberg, and Audre Lorde are just a few of the poets gathered here, alongside a host of new young voices. Encompassing as many moods, characters, and scenes as this multifaceted, ever-changing metropolis has to offer, Poems of New York will be treasured by literary lovers of New York everywhere.The New YorkerIn 1811, city planners unveiled the urban grid that would become the New York we know; not long afterward, the city's first poet, Walt Whitman, came along to chronicle its particular nexus of enthusiasm, expansiveness, and elegant ennui. This well-selected volume of New York poems, conceived in the days following September 11, 2001, includes not only the tried-and-true anthology pieces but an assortment of excellent lesser-known poems; we're reminded that in New York all things end ""Too soon! Too soon!"" (as Ferlinghetti exclaimed), although the city's sophisticated residents will murmur only ""It gets so terribly late"" (Elizabeth Bishop, teasing a friend). There are some stirring September 11th elegies here, but Whitman's words speak most consolingly, across the century, to the city's new sense of strength imperilled: ""It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, / The dark threw its patches down upon me also.""","2002","1"

"Writings: The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man, Along This Way, Essays and Editorials, Selected Poems","James Weldon Johnson","9781931082525","The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (1912), James Weldon Johnson's first book and the first modernist novel written by an African American, is a groundbreaking and subtle account of racial passing, initially published as an anonymous memoir. Its veracitymany believed it to be a genuine autobiographyhas made it one of the undisputed masterpieces of African American literature and established Johnson in the African American literary vanguard of the first half of the twentieth century. He was also one of the central figures of the civil-rights struggle of his era, a tireless activist and longtime leader of the NAACP. Until now, however, his innovative and fascinating writings have never been gathered in a one-volume edition.  Johnson's complex career spanned the worlds of diplomacy (as a U.S. consul in Venezuela and Nicaragua), politics (as secretary of the NAACP), journalism (as the founder of one newspaper and longtime editor of another), and musical theater (as lyricist for the Broadway song-writing team of Cole and Johnson Brothers). Writings presents a generous array of Johnson's essays which, with the early work of W.E.B. Du Bois, established the foundation of twentieth- century African American literary criticism; a selection of his topical editorials from the New York Age; and an offering of his poems and lyrics, including God's Trombonesa brilliant verse homage to African American preachingvaudeville songs, protest poems, and perhaps Johnson's most famous work, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a stirring hymn often called the “Negro National Anthem.”Library JournalThe Library of America's latest offering combines the author's noted 1912 novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man and his 1933 autobiography Along This Way plus numerous essays and his New York Age editorials covering a plethora of subjects.

"Bronx Accent: A Literary and Pictorial History of the Borough","Lloyd Ultan","9780813538624","While The Bronx is presently undergoing a renaissance, a mention of this borough often conjures up ""Fort-Apache-the-Bronx"" images of urban blight and crime. Yet for the last three hundred years, and through all its various social and economic transformations/ The Bronx has been a major literary center that many prominent writers have called home.This comprehensive book captures the Zeitgeist of The Bronx through the eyes of its writers-both past literary figures and emerging talents. Lloyd Ultan and Barbara Unger place this literature in its historical context and reproduce here one hundred vintage photographs and postcard views that bring the writings to life. The resulting book provides the reader with insights into the kaleidoscopic shifts in Bronx life over the centuries. Filtered through the imaginations of authors of different times, ethnic groups, social classes, and literary styles, the borough of The Bronx emerges not only as a shaper of destinies and lives, but as an important literary mecca.

"New York Nocturne: The City After Dark in Literature, Painting, and Photography, 1850-1950","William Chapman Sharpe","9780691133249","""New York Nocturne is a wonderfully rich plum pudding of a book on the evolution of the modern urban environment and how it has been perceived, especially in New York. Teeming with little-known history and keen critical insight, this study illuminates how artists and writers made imaginative capital of the changing New York nightscape. Their vision helped construct the image of New York as we still see it today: a city that never sleeps, a brilliantly lit stage set that comes alive in dramatic, even thrilling ways after dark.""--Morris Dickstein, CUNY Graduate Center""New York Nocturne is a tour de force of scholarship and an instant classic. I cannot think of another book that so convincingly shows the connections between technological innovation, spatial transformation, and cultural change.""--Steven Hoelscher, University of Texas, Austin""New York Nocturne raises important questions concerning the history of cities, urban modernism and modernity, and the relationship of technology to the urban experience. The breadth is ambitious and the text is studded with lovely analyses of individual works.""--Rebecca Zurier, University of MichiganThe Barnes &amp; Noble ReviewThe blackout of 2003 offered New Yorkers their most recent opportunity to experience something exceedingly rare: the city enveloped in darkness. William Chapman Sharpe begins New York Nocturne at a time when nighttime darkness was the norm and light -- first in the form of gas, then of electricity -- was radically disorienting, eventually transforming patterns of commerce and leisure. In this gorgeous, erudite book, the Barnard College professor examines the myriad ways that writers, painters, and photographers have represented New York nightlife, beginning in the mid-19th century, when works by Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, and Edgar Allan Poe dramatized the moral perils of the artificially lit city. Sharpe's journey takes him to the middle of the 20th century, by which time artists like Edward Hopper and Weegee exploit the nighttime's theatrical, voyeuristic potential. In between he covers James McNeill Whistler, Stephen Crane, John Sloan, Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O'Keeffe, Joseph Stella, and many others, with close readings of the literature and black-and-white and color reproductions of the art. Sharpe, whose own affection for the city is charmingly apparent here, insists throughout that artists and writers haven't simply reacted to the changes in urban existence; rather, they have ""helped turn the unscouted terrain of the urban night into a legible part of contemporary life."" --Barbara Spindel","2008","4"

"Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology","Paul Hoover","9780393310900","Beginning in 1950 with Charles Olsen, Postmodern American Poetry: A Norton Anthology is the first anthology since Donald Allen’s groundbreaking collection to fully represent the movements of American avant-garde poetry.Publishers WeeklyConcentration and magnification make the best anthologies work, and this may be one of them. Concentration: the focus on a body of writing with a heritage, an era, or a style in common that tests shared visions and constraints. Magnification: an expanse that seems to widen and deepen as we are allowed to take a look at it, and then another look. For anyone carping at the idea of the postmodern or the avant-garde as wanly intellectual, fiercely separatist, beside the point, or even nonexistent, Hoover's large-scale collection of recent experimental American poetry (and a concluding selection of essays about it) should persuade that it's not. He brings together more than 100 writers from the 1950s and since--Olson, Duncan, O'Hara, Ginsberg, Corso, Dorn, Major, Ashbery, Guest--whose adventures with the language renew it for far more than a readymade membership. The fact that some of the poets are sine qua nons and others aren't simply leaves the whole tribe more interesting. There's almost no point in listing names, except to indicate breadth; the same could be said for the ``schools'' represented. For literary positions have a way easing from their own strictures and outgrowing acolytic expectation when the words themselves are richly transformed and reformed--as they are here.

"Message to Aztlan: Selected Readings","Rodolfo Gonzales","9781558853317","One of the most famous leaders of the Chicano civil rights movement, Rodolfo ""Corky"" Gonzales, was a multifaceted and charismatic, bigger-than-life hero who inspired his followers not only by taking direct political action but also by making eloquent speeches, writing incisive essays, and creating the kind of socially engaged poetry and drama that could be communicated easily throughout the barrios of Aztlan, the communities populated by Chicanos in the United States. Gonzales is the author of I Am Joaquin, an epic poem of the Chicano Movement that lives on in film, sound recording, and hundreds of anthologies. Gonzales and other Chicanos established the Crusade for Justice, a Denver-based civil rights organization, school, and community center, in 1966. The school, La Escuela Tlatelolco, lives on today some three decades after its founding. In Message to Aztlan, Dr. Antonio Esquibel, Professor Emeritus of Metropolitan State College of Denver, has compiled the first collection of Gonzales' diverse writings: the original I Am Joaquin (1967), along with a new Spanish translation; seven major speeches (1968-78); two plays, The Revolutionist and A Cross for Maclovio (1966-67); various poems written during the 1970s and a selection of letters. These varied works demonstrate the evolution of Gonzales' thought on human and civil rights. Any examination of the Chicano Movement is incomplete without this volume. An eight-page photo insert accompanies the text.Library JournalThis edition features selected writings of the Chicano civil rights leader, handpicked by Gonzales himself with the help of his longtime friend and political associate Esquibel (emeritus, Metropolitan State Coll. of Denver). The years represented in these writings, 1966-1980, were important ones for the Chicano movement, as mainstream America had just begun to wake up to the concerns of Mexican Americans and other Latin American citizens. As his speeches reveal, Gonzales was a key figure. His words expose and attack the cultural stereotypes plaguing his people for centuries under Euro-American domination and emphasize education for the Chicano people, both academic and political. Also included in this work is the famous ""Yo Soy Joaquin,"" an epic poem covering the history of Aztec civilization and the fate of its descendants today. Gonzales's poetry and plays (also featured in this edition) may seem a bit dated and melodramatic today, but they are historically important and represent the struggles encountered by Chicanos up to the 1980s. Gonzales hoped that this work would ""inspire and motivate a new generation of Chicanos,"" and for this reason it belongs in academic libraries and public libraries with many Chicano or Mexican American patrons.

"Among the Blacks","Ron Padgett","9780939691029","Fiction. African American Studies. Translated from the French. AMONG THE BLACKS consists of two works: Ron Padgett's translation of Raymond Roussel's early story ""Parmi les noirs,"" first published in 1935 in his book Comment j'ai ecrit certain de mes livres, together with Padgett's memoir focusing upon his own experience among black people. Roussel's story, about a master mariner named White who encounters an African chief named Booltable, is built upon the kind of whimsical and extravagant word play (its first and last sentences are identical except for one letter in one word--""pooltable""/ ""Booltable"") for which Roussel was idolized by the French Surrealists. In contrast, as he writes in his Afterword, Padgett's memoir ""grew out of the nagging need to come to grips with the frustrations of being a white American who had grown up in a racist environment and who, despite his rejections of racism at an early age, had rarely felt unselfconscious in the company of a black person.""

"The Butterfly's Way: Voices from the Haitian Dyaspora in the United States","Edwidge Danticat","9781569472187","In five sections - Childhood, Migration, Half / First Generation, Return, and Future - the contributors to this anthology write powerfully, often hauntingly, of their lives in Haiti and the United States. Jean-Robert Cadet's description of his Haitian childhood as a restavek - a child slave - in Port-au-Prince contrasts with Dany Laferiere's account of a ten-year-old boy and his beloved grandmother in Petit-Goave. We read of Marie Helene Laforest's realization that while she was white in Haiti, in the United States she is black. Patricia Benoit tells us of a Haitian woman regugee in a detention center who has a simple need, a red dress - dignity. The reaction of a man when he marries the woman he loves is the theme of Gary Pierre-Pierre's ""The White Wife""; the feeling of alienation is explored in ""Made Outside"" by Francie Latour. The frustration of trying to help those who remained and of the do-gooders who do more for themselves than the Haitians is described in Babette Wainwright's ""Do Somthing for Your Soul, Go to Haiti."" The variations and permutations of the divided self of the Haitian emigrant are poignantly conveyed in this unique anthology.Publishers WeeklyThe experience of Haitian migr s in what novelist Danticat (Krik? Krak!; etc.) calls the ""tenth"" geographical ""department"" of Haiti--""the floating homeland, the ideological one, which joined all Haitians living in the dyaspora""--is the theme of this collection of 33 spare and evocative essays and poems. Most of these writers fled political instability as children and describe the dual reality of alienation from yetbelonging to two worlds, forging an identity separate from that of their parents in the new country, while at the same time continuing to wait for stability in the old country. Nik l Payen tells of her experience as a U.S. Justice Department-sponsored interpreter who uses her knowledge of Krey l (""the language whose purpose in life up until now had been to pain and confuse me"") as ""an asset"" to translate for refugees waiting in horrific conditions at Guantanamo Naval Base following the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. When she witnesses the return of some of these Haitians--denied entrance to the U.S.--she likens their journey to the African Middle Passage. In another, Marie-H l ne Laforest, whose lighter skin color and family's wealth made her ""white"" in Haiti, realizes that she is simply black in America and later forges a third identity in Italy. Francie Latour, a journalist, convinces her American newspaper to send her to Haiti with a noble aim, but ends up ""hitting a cultural wall"" and being viewed as a ""traitor"" by her native people. This rich collection of writings will appeal to the growing number of Haitian-Americans and others interested in the question of the migr 's sense of identity. (Feb.)

"For She Is the Tree of Life: Grandmothers Through the Eyes of Women Writers","Valerie Kack-Brice","9781573240376","For many women, memories of their grandmothers open up a Pandora's box if thoughts, feeling, and images. Filled with poems, stories, photographs, this anthology reveals the rich variety of these connections, as writers such as M.F.K. Fisher, MargaretAtwood, Isabel Allende, and Maya Angelou explore their relati onships with their grandmothers. Photos.Publishers WeeklyThis engaging collection of short pieces of autobiography, fiction and poetry, some published previously, deals with the grandmother-granddaughter relationship. According to Kack-Brice, a California clinical social worker, memories of grandmothers, whether positive or negative, are a powerful connection to childhood, and the exploration of these reminiscences can lead to deeper self-knowledge. Many of the selections, including the poetry of Marge Piercy and Linda Hogan and memoirs by Ethel Barrymore and Maya Angelou, evoke grandmothers as figures of strength and inspiration. Other contributors, such as M.F.K. Fisher and Stephanie Patterson, describe more troubled relationships with their grandmothers. A touching selection by Jewelle Gomez recalls how her grandmother accepted her lesbianism. Exercises for the reader who wants to write about her own grandmother are provided by the contributors.

"Oxford Anthology of African American Poetry","Arnold Rampersad","9780195125634","For over two centuries, black poets have created verse that captures the sorrows, joys, and triumphs of the African-American experience. Reflecting their variety of visions and styles, The Oxford Anthology of African-American Poetry aims to offer nothing less than a definitive literary portrait of a people.  Here are poems by writers as different as Paul Laurence Dunbar and W.E.B. Du Bois; Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes; Gwendolyn Brooks and Amiri Baraka; Rita Dove and Harryette Mullen; Yusef Komunyakaa and Nathaniel Mackey. Acclaimed as a biographer and editor, Arnold Rampersad groups these poems as meditations on key issues in black culture, including the idea of Africa; the South; slavery; protest and resistance; the black man, woman, and child; sexuality and love; music and religion; spirituality; death and transcendence. With their often starkly contrasting visions and styles, these poets illuminate some of the more controversial and intimate aspects of the black American experience. Poetry here is not only or mainly a vehicle of protest but also an exploration of the complex and tender subtleties of black culture. One section offers tributes to celebrated leaders such as Sojourner Truth and Malcolm X, but many more reflect the heroism compelled by everyday black life. The variety of poetic forms and language captures the brilliant essence of English as mastered by black Americans dedicated to the art of poetry.  Loving and yet also honest and unsparing, The Oxford Anthology of African-American Poetry is for readers who treasure both poetry and the genius of black America.","2005","3"

"Dream Me Home Safely: Writers on Growing Up in America","Susan Richards Shreve","9780618379026","In the title essay of this extraordinary keepsake of childhood in America, John Edgar Wideman pays fierce tribute to a complex mother who ""used to dream me home safely by sitting up and waiting for me to stumble in."" The young writer Bich Minh Nguyen remembers arriving in Michigan from Vietnam in 1975 and a classmate who said, ""Your house smells funny,"" and Michael Parker recalls a sister's vivid -- and hilarious -- act of defiance on a particular North Carolina evening in 1971. These and many more intensely intimate memories make Dream Me Home Safely a collection as diverse and powerful as all of American letters.Publishers WeeklyIn today's diverse society, it's no longer possible for an individual voice to capture a singular American view of childhood. Dissimilar experiences can each sound uniquely American, such as the stability of Patricia Elam's refreshingly functional family, in which ""the only thing that distinguished us from the families on Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It to Beaver, and Father Knows Best... was our brown skin""; the quiet confusion of Michael Patrick MacDonald, who ""decided that `normal' certainly meant something somewhere out there, beyond... where we lived""; or the poignant isolation of Nina Revoyr as the only Japanese child in Marshfield, Wis. This collection successfully gathers many voices, completing an impassioned picture of growing up in America. Thirty-four authors, including Chang-rae Lee, Alice Walker and John Edgar Wideman, lyrically portray their younger years. Each piece-whether describing the bluffs of Illinois, the movie houses of Paris, Tex., or Christmas in Alabama-illustrate how childhood informs adulthood. As Lisa Page writes, as we age, ""the child remains, transcended, often denied, but there all the same, hiding beneath our business suits, our corporate uniforms, the camouflage we wear to communicate our grown-up selves."" While most essays are magical, a few are forced and the flow of the anthology suffers from its alphabetical, rather than thematic, organization. But these are easily overlooked flaws in this beautiful compilation that proves that ""childhood, of course, never ends."" (Oct. 22) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.","2003","9"
"Bum Rush the Page: A Def Poetry Jam","Tony Medina","9780609808405","Bum Rush the Page is a groundbreaking collection, capturing the best new work from the poets who have brought fresh energy, life, and relevance to American poetry.“Here is a democratic orchestration of voices and visions, poets of all ages, ethnicities, and geographic locations coming together to create a dialogue and to jam–not slam. This is our mouth on paper, our hearts on our sleeves, our refusal to shut up and swallow our silence. These poems are tough, honest, astute, perceptive, lyrical, blunt, sad, funny, heartbreaking, and true. They shout, they curse, they whisper, and sing. But most of all, they tell it like it is.” –Tony Medina, from the IntroductionPublishers WeeklyTo most readers, the hundreds of tightly rhymed, orally friendly poems here will read as ""slam."" But in his introduction, Medina, a poet and activist, takes great pains to separate the poems from slam's crowd-pleasing limitations, and uses the term ""def jam"" to describe the political spoken-word poetry he and Rivera, also a poet-activist, have collected. Medina's and Rivera's emphasis is on the poem and its subject matter, not the poet, which makes for a remarkably democratic anthology. Every poet has about the same page and a half of space. The book's design puts the poets' names in a very small type. None of the big names June Jordan, Reg E. Gaines, Edwin Torres, Wanda Coleman, Patricia Smith and Amiri Baraka are given more attention than the less published. Organized by subjects such as ""Blood, I Say, Study our Story, Sing this Song,"" ""Drums Drown Out Our Sorrow"" and ""Seeds of Resistance,"" most of the poems use urban imagery, tough talk and declaration. Most are identity-centered, anti-racist and pro-activist. Many focus on current events. There are, for instance, at least four poems about Amadou Diallo, the unarmed Ghanaian immigrant killed by New York policemen as he stood in his doorway. All mention the 41 shots; all include the word ""mother."" There are poems about Shaka Sankofa (convicted of murder at 17, and executed nearly 20 years later under Texas's then-Governor George W. Bush), and homages to Cuban bandleader Tito Puente. Some readers will wish for more variation of theme and for more layered meanings, but the topicality and directness of the poems make this an ideal textbook for introductory poetry classes, especially for urban high school students, and for anyone interestedin poetry as a social art.

"Women Writing Africa: The Southern Region: Volume 1","Sheila Meintjes","9781558614062","An essential text for librariesthe definitive collection of women's literatures from southern Africa.Library JournalThis rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women's literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana's lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume's editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text's headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language. Essential for all academic libraries and highly recommended for larger public libraries.-Neal Wyatt, Chesterfield Cty. P.L., VA Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.","2002","5"

Rosenblum, who edits the City section, has collected 40 representative pieces that showcase the ups and downs of life in a metropolis that still exerts a gravitational pull on those seeking their fortune. Many of the essays are by well-known authors, such as Jan Morris, Phillip Lopate and Vivian Gornick, but others, equally winning, are by emerging writers. All of the pieces are engrossing and share a painstaking attention to craft. Mel Gussow dramatically evokes the day in 1970 when the Greenwich Village townhouse next door to him, occupied by members of the radical Weather Underground, was blown apart in an accidental detonation in their basement bomb factory.

"American Protest Literature","Zoe Trodd","9780674027633","“I like a little rebellion now and then”—so wrote Thomas Jefferson to Abigail Adams, enlisting in a tradition that throughout American history has led writers to rage and reason, prophesy and provoke. This is the first anthology to collect and examine an American literature that holds the nation to its highest ideals, castigating it when it falls short and pointing the way to a better collective future.American Protest Literature presents sources from eleven protest movements—political, social, and cultural—from the Revolution to abolition to gay rights to antiwar protest. Each section reprints documents from the original phase of the movement as well as evidence of its legacy in later times. Informative headnotes place the selections in historical context and draw connections with other writings within the anthology and beyond. Sources include a wide variety of genres—pamphlets, letters, speeches, sermons, legal documents, poems, short stories, photographs, posters—and a range of voices from prophetic to outraged to sorrowful, from U.S. Presidents to the disenfranchised. Together they provide an enlightening and inspiring survey of this most American form of literature.L. L. Johnson - ChoiceTrodd organizes this excellent anthology around 11 reform movements, most based on race, class, or gender (e.g., the American Revolution, abolition, women's suffrage, gay rights). Collecting the work of both established writers and new voices, the book comprises some hundred pieces (1-3 pages each): prose excerpts, political documents, poems, photographs, film briefs, essays, fiction, narratives, and orations...This excellent book can serve as a textbook as well as a resource on social change and the literature thereof.

This is a knock-out anthology: indispensable for anyone who cares about American literature and the place of California in the national imagination."" Michael Kowalewski, editor, Gold Rush: A Literary Exploration, and former president of the Western Literature Association ""This marvelous collection of literature creates a sense of time and place like no other in the world. California starts in native origin stories; the songs of many cultures and mighty landscapes rightly open this literary treasury. The literature of exploration, conquest, and separation is followed by the rise of romance, irony, adventure and, in the last section, a return to the stories of cultural diversity.

"Americans in Paris: A Literary Anthology","Adam Gopnik","9781931082563","From the earliest years of the American republic, Paris has provoked an extraordinary American literary response. An almost inevitable destination for writers and thinkers, Paris has been many things to many Americans: a tradition-bound bastion of the old world of Europe; a hotbed of revolutionary ideologies in politics and art; and a space in which to cultivate an openness to life and love thought impossible at home. Including stories, letters, memoirs, and journalism, Americans in Paris distills three centuries of vigorous, glittering, and powerfully emotional writing about the place that Henry James called “the most brilliant city in the world.”  American writers came to Paris as statesmen, soldiers, students, tourists, and sometimes they stayed as expatriates. This anthology ranges from the crucial early impressions of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin to the latter-day reflections of writers as varied as James Baldwin, Isadora Duncan, and Jack Kerouac. Along the way we encounter the energetic travelers of the nineteenth centuryEmerson, Mark Twain, Henry Jamesand the pilgrims of the twentieth: Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, E. E. Cummings, Cole Porter, Henry Miller. Come along as Thomas Paine takes a direct and dangerous part in the French Revolution; Harriet Beecher Stowe tours the Louvre; Theodore Dreiser samples the sensual enticements of Parisian night life; Edith Wharton movingly describes Paris in the early days of World War I; John Dos Passos charts the gathering political storms of the 1930s; Paul Zweig recalls the intertwined pleasures of language and sex; and A. J. Liebling savors the memory of his culinary education in delicious detail.  Americans in Paris is a diverse and constantly engaging mosaic, full of revealing cultural gulfs and misunderstandings, personal and literary experimentation, and profound moments of self-discovery.The New York TimesAlthough Americans in Paris has a chronological structure, Mr. Gopnik still gives it a soupçon of suspense: the reader moves from section to section wondering whether the book can top what it has just delivered.

"Latina","Lillian Castillo-speed","9780684802404","Latina brings together a remarkable selection of writings, gathering essays, short stories, and excerpts from novels that have attracted a wide readership and critical praise, as well as original pieces by lesser-known authors. Many of the works here draw on the special experience of being a member of a minority group; all speak to the universal human condition. The contributors include such well-known names as Sandra Cisneros, Julia Alvarez, Denise Chavez, Ana Castillo, Cristina Garcia, and Sandra Benitez. Mexican Americans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and other women of the Americas are all represented. They write of their heritage; of their lives in an often alienating land; of the joys and sorrows of their particular communities; and of their political concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.Publishers WeeklySampling works from over 30 contemporary female Latin writers, this is a worthwhile and fashionable digest. The stories, recollections, letters and essays range widely in topic, tone, style and quality. Unfortunately, most of the strongest pieces are buried deep in the book. Among them, the story ``Personality Fabulosa'' by Monica Palacios captures with deceptive levity a heavy crush at the moment it develops into mutual courtship. Also terrific, Lucha Corpi's essay, ``Epiphany: The Third Gift'' depicts a tomboy distressing her traditional parents, who find solace in her bookishness: ""`When you educate a man,' my father would often tell my younger sister and me, `you educate an individual. But when you educate a woman, you educate the whole family.'"" Mary Helen Ponce's ``Just Dessert'' deftly portrays a disastrous dinner date, as the woman futilely tries to concentrate on the man's gorgeous lips and ignore the bigotry coming out of them. The stories of Cristina Garca, Aurora Levins Morales, Kathleen Ann Gonzlez and Judith Ortiz Cofer also work brilliantly. Less successfully, other writers rely too much on their ethnicity for interest rather than intrinsic merit. For example, Esmeralda Santiago's excerpt comes across as politically correct and facile: ``Americanos talk funny when they speak Spanish.'' By and large, however, the several gems in this collection outweigh the weak parts. (Aug.)","1995","6"

Combining literary impressions, history, and personal narrative with stunning color photographs, this remarkable book transports readers to places most have never been: three hundred feet below the city of Chicago in a TARP pump station, above the Illinois River in a lift-bridge operator’s hut, in the wheelhouse of a towboat pushing twenty thousand tons. The story of the river is told by the people who live along the waterway’s banks and work its course, who rely on it for their livelihoods, their recreation, and their spiritual sustenance. More than one hundred original color photographs and dozens of conversations with waterway residents, workers, and visitors capture the essence of the waterway, exposing its course and uncovering its past.Traveling through the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal, Florence, Hardin, Lemont, and Chicago, readers discover a connection to a sense of place and to the early inhabitants of the state. Bar crews, lockmasters, engineers, and those whose memories stretch to the days of steamboats offer their views on the evolution and navigational importance of the waterway. Readers encounter such places as Pekin, LaGrange, Peru, and Joliet as a towboat works its way up the waterway that represents commerce and jobs, the challenge of living and working away from home, and following dreams.The book also introduces Chicago fishermen and wastewater engineers, a city bridge machinist and a marine police officer, who offer insights aboard a patrol boat on the Chicago River, inside a bascule bridge, and in a sailboat marina, revealing an engineering marvel upstream that creates an environmental nightmare downstream.From Mud Creek to Peoria Lakes, a biologist, an ecologist, and a hydrologist consider the edge of the watershed Meredosia, Chandlerville, Henry, the Kankakee River and its tributaries and discuss the changing nature of the river, including new threats such as sedimentation, and the loss of habitat. Hunters, commercial fishermen, and bridge tenders share their stories that demonstrate resiliency in the face of great change.A River Through Illinois represents a unique blend of portraits, landscapes, panoramic 360-degree photographs, and personal narratives that create a cast of characters, including the river itself, who give voice to the life of this important waterway. &nbsp;","2008","8"

"Bandana Republic: A Literary Anthology by Gang Members and Their Affliliates","Louis Reyes Rivera","9781593761943","Urban youth gangs are typically viewed as no more than training grounds for thugs and felons. This breakthrough anthology presents a far different picture, revealing present and former gang members’ and street activists’ artistic impulses, emotional sensitivities, political beliefs, and capacities to assess the social conditions that created them. The Bandana Republic contains powerful writing: fiction and essays, poetry, and polemics written by adolescents from gangs like the Crips and Bloods and the Mexican Mafia. There's also creative work by ex-gangbangers who have become activists, artists, musicians, and movie stars. J. Sheeler’s “Seven Immortals” finds grim poetry in a young girl’s gang initiation.

"The Wind Shifts: New Latino Poetry","Francisco Aragón","9780816524938","Join us across the nation with The Wind Shifts ON TOURThe Wind Shifts gathers, for the first time, works by emerging Latino and Latina poets in the twenty-first century. Here readers will discover 25 new and vital voices including Naomi Ayala, Richard Blanco, David Dominguez, Gina Franco, Sheryl Luna, and UrayoÃ¡n Noel. All of the writers included in this volume have published poetry in well-regarded literary magazines. Some have published chapbooks or first collections, but none had published more than one book at the time of selection. This results in a freshness that energizes the enterprise. Certainly there is poetry here that is political, but this is not a polemical book; it is a poetry book. While conscious of their roots, the artists are equally conscious of living in the contemporary worldfully engaged with the possibilities of subject and language. The variety is tantalizing. There are sonnets and a sestina; poems about traveling and living overseas; poems rooted in the natural world and poems embedded in suburbia; poems nourished by life on the U.S.-Mexico border and poems electrified by living in Chicago or Los Angeles or San Francisco or New York City. Some of the poetry is traditional; some is avant-garde; some is informed by traditional poetry in Spanish; some follows English forms that are hundreds of years old. There are love poems, spells that defy logic, flashes of hope, and moments of loss. In short, this is the rich and varied poetry of young, talented North American Latinos and Latinas.","2007","9"

What Teresa Jordan calls the ``interior'' or ``hidden stories'' of family, loneliness and emotional trial have been largely passed over by traditional male Western storytellers, but this collection offers insight into more intimate epics like Jordan's story of an Indian girl and her father, an ex-convict unable to make a life for himself off the reservation, who teaches her to make her life ``her own.'' The collection starts with Blew's nostalgic blurring of dream and memory but ends with Terry Tempest Williams's ``The Clan of One-Breasted Women'' about a Utah Mormon who discovers that the flash of light she thought was a dream was a real nuclear explosion and breaks with conservative tradition by questioning authority when her mother, both grandmothers and six aunts develop breast cancer. Although there are flawed contributions, this evocative collection with works by Tess Gallagher, Melanie Rae Thon, Anita Endrezze, Gretel Ehrlich, Cyra McFadden and others, coheres in examining Western myths and traditions through the lives of women.

"American Fantastic Tales: Terror and the Uncanny from Poe to the Pulps","Peter Straub","9781598530476","From early on, American literature has teemed with tales of horror, of hauntings, of terrifying obsessions and gruesome incursions, of the uncanny ways in which ordinary reality can be breached and subverted by the unknown and the irrational. As this pathbreaking two-volume anthology demonstrates, it is a tradition with many unexpected detours and hidden chambers, and one that continues to evolve, finding new forms and new themes as it explores the bad dreams that lurk around the edgesif not in the unacknowledged heartof the everyday. Peter Straub, one of today's masters of horror and fantasy, offers an authoritative and diverse gathering of stories calculated to unsettle and delight. This first volume surveys a century and a half of American fantastic storytelling, revealing in its 44 stories an array of recurring themes: trance states, sleepwalking, mesmerism, obsession, possession, madness, exotic curses, evil atmospheres. In the tales of Irving, Poe, and Hawthorne, the bright prospects of the New World face an uneasy reckoning with the forces of darkness. In the ghost-haunted Victorian and Edwardian eras, writers including Henry James, Edith Wharton, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Ambrose Bierce explore ever more refined varieties of spectral invasion and disintegrating selfhood. In the twentieth century, with the arrival of the era of the pulps, the fantastic took on more monstrous and horrific forms at the hands of H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, and other classic contributors to Weird Tales. Here are works by acknowledged masters such as Stephen Crane, Willa Cather, Conrad Aiken, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, along with surprising discoveries like Ralph Adams Cram's ""The Dead Valley,"" Emma Francis Dawson's ""An Itinerant House,"" and Julian Hawthorne's ""Absolute Evil."" American Fantastic Tales offers an unforgettable ride through strange and visionary realms.Publishers WeeklyStarred Review. In a time when the Fantastic is regaining popularity in American literature, this wide-ranging collection of horror and supernatural stories is a welcomed reeducation into the genre's roots. Some of the selections are already unquestioned classics-Hawthorne's ""Young Goodman Brown,"" Poe's ""Berenice,"" Gilman's ""The Yellow Wall Paper."" Although, any reader may find Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Henry S. Whitehead, David H. Keller, Seabury Quinn, Francis Stevens, H.L. Lovecraft and August Derleth just as worthy. Even those most well-acquainted with the genre will be pleasantly surprised with the tales by lesser-known writers, such as Willa Cather's ""Consequences"" and Gertrude Atherton's ""The Striding Place."" Editor Straub highlights a Feminist strain with female writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries: Harriet Prescott Spoofed, Kate Chopin, Madeline Yale Wynne, Alice Brown-to name a few, offering an interesting reassessment of a crucial era in fantastic fiction.

In this unforgettable collection, the women of York describe in their own words how they were imprisoned by abuse, rejection, and their own self-destructive impulses long before they entered the criminal justice system. Yet these are powerful stories of hope and healing, told by writers who have left victimhood behind.In his moving introduction, Lamb describes the incredible journey of expression and self-awareness the women took through their writing and shares how they challenged him as a teacher and as a fellow author. Couldn't Keep It to Myself is a true testament to the process of finding oneself and working toward a better day.The Los Angeles TimesOne truth this book affirms is the capacity for people to change. The writers of Couldn't Keep It to Myself chart their own journeys of growth, navigating the terrain of their internal worlds, their pasts and present prison realities. Who they have become is clear both in self-awareness and what they do with their lives teaching others, advocacy, computer work, construction in prison and out. It is in this change that hope resides; lying next to and rising out of despair, hope permeates the book. Why, in the end, does Lamb want us to care about 10 women in prison? Perhaps because in noticing the humanity of others, we become more human ourselves. — Kathy Boudin","2004","8"

"Quixotic Fictions of the USA 1792-1815","Sarah Florence Wood","9780199273157","Quixotic Fictions of the USA 1792-1815 explores the conflicted and conflicting interpretations of Don Quixote available to and deployed by disenchanted writers of America's new republic. It argues that the legacy of Don Quixote provided an ambiguous cultural icon and ironic narrative stance that enabled authors to critique with impunity the ideological fictions shoring up their fractured republic. Close readings of works such as Modern Chivalry, Female Quixotism, and The Algerine Captive reveal that the fiction from this period repeatedly engaged with Cervantes's narrative in order to test competing interpretations of republicanism, to interrogate the new republic's multivalent crises of authority, and to question both the possibility and the desirability of an isolationist USA and an autonomous ""American"" literature. Sarah Wood's study is the first book-length publication to examine the role of Don Quixote in early American literature. Exploring the extent to which the literary culture of North America was shaped by a diverse range of influences, it addresses an issue of growing concern to scholars of American history and literature. Quixotic Fictions reaffirms the global reach of Cervantes's influence and explores the complex, contradictory ways in which Don Quixote helped shape American fiction at a formative moment in its development.","2006","2"

"A Loving Voice II: A Caregiver's Book of More Read-Aloud Stories for the Elderly","Carolyn Banks","9780914783701","The second of two very popular and unique anthologies of short stories that were written specifically be read out-loud to older adults, A Loving Voice II: A Caregiver's Book of More Read-Aloud Stories for the Elderly, offers an imaginative and creative way for family members, friends and professionals to reach out to, communicate with, and entertain the older people in their care, particularly those who are bed-ridden, confined to a nursing home or hospital and those with dementia or those beginning to slip into it. In a moment of inspiration that has been much-welcomed ever since by caregivers the world over, the idea for A Loving Voice came to it's editors, Carolyn Banks and Janis Rizzo, when they recognized the desperate need for, and the serious lack of, reading material for this large and ever-growing segment of the population. In response, they invited hundreds of writers to submit stories and poems for their anthology. The 56 selections they ended up including are those that they and the eldercare experts they consulted felt would be most valuable and entertaining for their elderly audience: stories that evoke nostalgic memories and warm feelings of the past, interesting stories that stimulate conversation, provide a bridge between the past and present and a bond between reader and listener. All of the selections can be read in one sitting (no longer than 10 minutes), are clear with easy-to-follow plots and simple dialogue that lends itself to reading aloud. Moreover, as Banks and Rizzo discovered, reading aloud is an intimate, warm and friendly activity that encourages physical closeness, something that is sorely needed as we age. As editor Carolyn Banksreports, ""The pieces we have chosen are not insultingly simple. Even those who are able to read these selections on their own will find them engaging and entertaining. These are stories and poems with purpose, stories and poems with heart, stories and poems we are proud to present. Each we hope will help you find your own loving voice.""Including short stories and poems written by an impressive array of American authors including Michael Dirda, Judith Bell and Christopher Woods as well as writers who are having their work appear in a book for the first time.This book and its accompanying first volume has received critical acclaim from professional caregivers and grateful family members alike and has been enthusiastically reviewed in hundreds of papers, magazines and journals for its inventive method of communicating with and bringing joy to the older adult.","1994","3"

Selections include works of history, memoirs, letters, and essays, as well as fiction, poetry, and drama. Adding to the importance of the volume are several selections from rare and little-known texts that have been translated into English for the first time.Library JournalThe compilers, scholars who have studied and written about the Latino population in the United States, have put together an anthology of literary works dealing with the panorama of Latino writings in the United States. The selections range widely, from Cabeza de Vaca's 1542 description of the South to recent excerpts from Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Mexican American authors. The collection is primarily literary though it does include some historical, autobiographical, and essay excerpts. It offers what would be expected in this type of anthology, with an occasional surprise, such as an excerpt from John Rechy's novel City of Night. Readers will be primarily college and university students, but this will also be of value to smaller public libraries with limited Latino collections.

Dick, Iceberg Slim, Gil Scott-Heron, Kathy Acker, Jim Carroll, Charles Mingus, Norman Mailer, and many others.Kirkus ReviewsIs an outlaw writer one who threatens to fill Marshall McLuhan with pencil lead? The editors of this overstuffed anthology never quite get around to defining just what ""outlaw literature"" is and what makes it illicit, dangerous, or otherwise suspect, except to hint that it stands in some sort of opposition to the world of ""reality shows, Botox, or IPOs,"" to say nothing of a ""culture coming of age in the grip of Google and Wal-mart."" Resounding sentiments, those, and the editors, famed counterculturists in their own right, presumably know outlaw literature when they see it. Still, you might wonder: What do Richard Brautigan and Mickey Spillane, who took home hefty advances and even heftier royalty checks, really have in common with, say, Boxcar Bertha and Sonny Barger? Would Emma Goldman have much to say to Valerie Solanas, Ray Bradbury to DMX? Only a deconstructionist, perhaps, could say with any authority. For our purposes, being an outlaw writer appears mostly to mean using lots of naughty words (Barry Gifford: ""Willie Wild Wong, you dumb motherfucker!""; Jim Carroll: ""'I am the proletariat, you dumb bastard,' he said, 'and I think those motherfuckers are off their rockers"") and doing lots of naughty and unhealthful things (Norman Mailer: ""I threw up a little while ago and my breath is foul""; William Burroughs: ""Junk sickness, suspended by codeine and hop, numbed by weeks of constant drinking, came back on me full force""). Still, there are lots of good and memorable things here, among them Paul Krassner's memoir of dropping acid with Groucho Marx; Dee Dee Ramone's heartfelt plea, ""Please don't kill me now, God. I would love to be the last Ramone to die"" (no such luck, sorry); and MalcolmX's spot-on prediction that after his death ""the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with 'hate.'"" A freeform category, then, marked by a rather shapeless but still quite readable, collection. Good stuff, if you like that sort of thing.","2004","9"

What could get a hardworking employee fired from her job? What could get a black woman in hot water with her white boyfriend? In a word...  HAIR. When does a few ounces feel like a few tons? When a doctor advises a black woman to start an exercise program and she wonders how she can do it without breaking a sweat. When an employer fires her for wearing a cultural hairstyle that's ""unprofessional,"" and she has to go to court to plead for her job. When she's with her man, and the moment she's supposed to let loose, she stops to secure her head scarf so he doesn't disturb the 'do. TENDERHEADED? Yes, definitely. All black women are, in one way or another. The issue is not only about looking good, but about feeling adequate in a society where the beauty standards are unobtainable for most women. Tenderheaded boldly throws open the closet where black women's skeletons have been threatening to burst down the door. In poems, essays, cartoons, photos, and excerpts from novels and plays, women and men speak to the meaning hair has for them, and for society. In an intimate letter, A'Leila Perry Bundles pays tribute to her great-grandmother, hair-care pioneer Madam C.J. Walker, who launched a generation of African-American businesswomen. Corporate consultant Cherilyn ""Liv"" Wright interviews men and women on the hilarious ways they handle ""the hair issue"" between the sheets. Art historian Henry John Drewal explores how hairstyles, in Yoruba culture, indicate spiritual destiny, and activist Angela Davis questions how her message of revolution got reduced to a hairstyle. Tenderheaded is as rich and diverse as the children of the African diaspora. With works by Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, bell hooks, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and other writers of passion, persuasion, and humor -- this is sure to be one of the most talked-about books of the year.Essence - Patrick Henry BassIn Tenderheaded, Pamela Johnson and Juliette Harris masterfully capture black women's quest for peace with their hair.

"Violence in Francophone African and Caribbean Women's Literature","Marie-Chantal Kalisa","9780803211025","African and Caribbean peoples share a history dominated by the violent disruptions of slavery and colonialism. While much has been said about these geographies of pain,” violence in the private sphere, particularly gendered violence, receives little attention. This book fills that void. It is a critical addition to the study of African and Caribbean women’s literatures at a time when women from these regions are actively engaged in articulating the ways in which colonial and postcolonial violence impact women.&nbsp;Chantal Kalisa examines the ways in which women writers lift taboos imposed on them by their society and culture and challenge readers with their unique perspectives on violence. Comparing women from different places and times, Kalisa treats types of violence such as colonial, familial, linguistic, and war-related, specifically linked to dictatorship and genocide. She examines Caribbean writers Michele Lacrosil, Simone Schwartz-Bart, Gisèle Pineau, and Edwidge Danticat, and Africans Ken Begul, Calixthe Beyala, Nadine Bar, and Monique Ilboudo. She also includes Sembène Ousmane and Frantz Fanon for their unique contributions to the questions of violence and gender.

"Less Than One and Double: A Feminist Reading of African Women's Writing","Kenneth W. Harrow","9780325070254","Harrow's provocative book introduces a psychoanalytic dimension to the study of African women's writing. In so doing, he opens up relatively uncharted terrain in African literary studies. Comprehensive, nuanced, occasionally lyrical, the book covers an impressive range of hitherto neglected francophone novels that are examined alongside canonical anglophone texts. The author places these texts in their colonial and postcolonial contexts, developing upon, and linking, structuralist theories of colonialism and patriarchy. This study offers a radical new position for those scholars who have long sought alternatives to the liberal humanist bias pervading many studies of African women's writing.Students often struggle with the models employed by feminist and postcolonial theorists such as Judith Butler and Homi Bhabha. The clarity with which Harrow explains the positions of such theorists makes his book an essential companion to, and commentary upon, their publications. Kenneth Harrow's study will be of interest not only to African literature specialists, but also to non-literary scholars concerned with questions about feminism, gender construction, colonialism, psychoanalysis, and postcolonial theory.","2001","4"

From London or Lvov, Bombay or Beijing, Dublin or Dusseldorf, people have come to America to remake themselves, their lives, and their identities. Despite political obstacles, popular indifference, or hostility, they put down roots here, and their social, cultural, and entrepreneurial energies helped forge the open and diverse society we live in.  The history of American immigration has often been told by those already here. Becoming Americans tells this epic story from the inside, gathering for the first time over 400 years of writing-from 17th-century Jamestown to contemporary Brooklyn and Los Angeles-by first-generation immigrants about the immigrant experience. In sum, over 80 writers create a vivid, passionate, and revealing firsthand account of the challenges and aspirations that define our dynamic, multicultural democracy. In nearly a hundred entries-poems, stories, novel excerpts, travel pieces, diary entries, memoirs, and letters-Becoming Americans presents the full range of the experience of coming to America: the reasons for departure, the journey itself, the shock and spectacle of first arrival, the passionate ambivalence toward the old country and the old life, and above all the struggle with the complexities of America.

"Philadelphia Stories: America's Literature of Race and Freedom","Samuel Otter","9780195395921","A historic and symbolic city on the border between slavery and freedom, antebellum Philadelphia was home to one of the largest and most influential ""free"" African American communities in the United States. The city was seen by residents and observers as the stage on which the possibilities of freedom would be tested and a post-slavery future would be played out for the nation. Philadelphia's charged setting produced a distinctive literary tradition that confronted issues of race, character, violence, and liberty. Verbal performance and social behavior assumed the weight of race and nation. The city's social experiments would have international consequences. This account of Philadelphia's literary history from 1790 to1860 brings together writers familiar (Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allan Poe, John Edgar Wideman), lesser known (Hugh Henry Brackenridge, George Lippard, Frank J. Webb), and obscure (Mathew Carey, Robert Montgomery Bird, William Whipper, Joseph Willson). It draws on a host of diverse, often discounted expressive forms, from fever accounts and metempsychic fiction to caricatures and book covers. Samuel Otter's authoritative study considers the significance of geographical, social, and literary ""place."" It offers a model for thinking about the relationships between literature and history and among European-American and African-American writers. It challenges conventional narratives of American literary history. And finally, it establishes Philadelphia as fundamental to our understanding of not only the political but also the imaginative life of nineteenth-century America.","2010","7"

"The Best American Poetry 2005","Paul Muldoon","9780743257589","Following the enormous success of her two bestselling novels, The Red Tent and Good Harbor, award-winning author Anita Diamant delivers a book of intimate reflections on the milestones, revelations, and balancing acts of life as a wife, mother, friend, and member of a religious community.Before The Red Tent, before Good Harbor, before and during six books on contemporary Jewish life, Anita Diamant was a columnist. Over the course of two decades, she wrote essays about friendship and family, work and religion, ultimately creating something of a public diary reflecting the shape and evolution of her life -- as well as the trends of her generation.Pitching My Tent collects the finest of these essays, all freshly revised, updated, and enriched with new material, forming a cohesive and compelling narrative. Organized into six parts, the shape of the book reflects the general shape of adult life, chronicling its emotional and practical milestones. There are sections on marriage and the nature of family (""Love, Marriage, Baby Carriage""); on the ties that bind mother and child (""My One and Only""); on the demands and rewards of friendship (""The Good Ship""); on the challenges of balancing Jewish and secular calendars (""Time Wise""); on midlife (""In the Middle""); and on what it means to embrace Judaism in today's culture (""Home for the Soul"").Publishers WeeklyThis extraordinarily popular series enters its 18th year with a strong, entertaining, accessible effort; Muldoon (Hay, Madoc, etc.) avoids polemics and lets readers focus on poems. Elder statesmen and big names put in expected appearances, some of them (A.R. Ammons, Donald Justice, Charles Bukowski) with posthumously published verse. John Ashbery's splendid ""In Dearest, Deepest Winter"" shows him attending to life after 9/11; Lyn Hejinian's contribution (excerpted from a book-length poem) attends to the vagaries of the inner life. Selections from less well-known writers favor clarity, technique, and humor, or at least wry irony: Victoria Chang describes ""Seven Changs"" who share her name; Marlys West's ""Ballad of the Subcontractor"" describes ""the workers who deserted"" her building, and the debate champion who irritated her in high school, ""like a star quarterback but/ Smaller, brighter."" Stacey Harwood assembles a clever prose poem out of nine (fake) ""Contributors' Notes."" The light touch, formal intricacy and attention to whimsy that have helped earn Muldoon international fame are all in evidence here; it makes for a cohesive collection, open to all the usual arguments about what's really ""best""--also always part of the fun.

Rosen","9780060953225","More seriously funny writing from American's most trusted humor anthology  Witty, wise, and just plain wonderful, the inaugural volume of this biennial, Mirth of a Nation, ensured a place for the best contemporary humor writing in the country. And with this second treasury, Michael J. Rosen has once again assembled a triumphant salute to one of America's greatest assets: its sense of humor. More than five dozen acclaimed authors showcase their hilariously inventive works, including Paul Rudnick, Henry Alford, Susan McCarthy, Media Person Lewis Grossberger, Ian Frazier, Richard Bausch, Amy Krouse Rosenthal, Nell Scovell, Andy Borowitz, and Ben Greenman  just to mention a handful so that the other contributors can justify their feelings that the world slights them. But there's more! More Mirth of a Nation includes scads of Unnatural Histories from Randy Cohen, Will Durst's ""Top Top-100 Lists"" (including the top 100 colors, foods, and body parts), and three unabridged (albeit rather short) chapbooks:David Bader's ""How to Meditate Faster"" (Enlightenment for those who keep asking, ""Are we done yet?"")Matt Neuman's ""49 Simple Things You Can Do to Save the Earth"" (for instance, ""Make your own honey"" and ""Share your shower."") Francis Heaney's ""Holy Tango of Poetry"" (which answers the question, ""What if poets wrote poems whose titles were anagrams of their names, i.e., 'Toilets,' by T. S. Eliot?"") And there's still more: ""The Periodic Table of Rejected Elements,"" meaningless fables, Van Gogh's Etch A Sketch drawings, a Zagat's survey of existence, an international baby-naming encyclopedia, Aristotle's long-lost treatise ""On Baseball,"" and an unhealthy selection of letters from Dr. Science's mailbag. And that's just for starters! Just remember, as one reviewer wrote of the first volume, ""Don't drink milk while reading.""Publishers WeeklyRegular readers of the New Yorker's Shouts &amp; Murmurs page and the Modern Humorist will likely have already digested some of the fare in this biennial collection of humor pieces, nearly all of which have been published elsewhere. Though big names like Steve Martin and Bruce McCall are trumpeted on the cover, the real treats can be found in the work of less famous contributors. Francis Heaney's ""Holy Tango of Poetry,"" which imagines the results of poets writing poems whose titles are anagrams of their names-e.g. ""I'm Leery Jocks"" by Joyce Kilmer, or ""Toilets"" by T.S. Eliot (""Let us go then, to the john,/ Where the toilet seats wait to be sat upon"")-is irresistibly goofy. Tim Carvell's account of his solo attempt at being a Neilsen family (he manufactured a couple of kids and wife named Gladys and made them all Eskimos) should be required reading for anyone who has ever longed to lie on annoying questionnaires. And Jeremy Simon's parody of an existential Zagat's guide is a witty send-up of a city staple (the entry for the opposable thumb reads: ""While this 'innovative' evolution-a 'pick-up joint' for the klutzy-is valued by locals for 'synergy' with its surroundings, dissenters dis it as 'overrated' 'finger food'""). Silly lists, ""unnatural histories,"" fake correspondences and countless other oddball selections round out this amusing volume. (Nov.) Copyright 2003 Cahners Business Information.","2002","5"
"The Best American Poetry 2003","Yusef Komunyakaa","9780743203883","""Poetry encourages us to have dialogue through the observed, the felt, and the imaginary,"" writes editor Yusef Komunyakaa in his thought-provoking introduction to The Best American Poetry 2003. As a black child of the American South and a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, Komunyakaa brings his singular vision to this outstanding volume. Included here is a diverse mix of senior masters, crowd-pleasing bards, rising stars, and the fresh voices of an emerging generation. With comments from the poets elucidating their work and series editor David Lehman's eloquent foreword assessing the state of the art, The Best American Poetry 2003 is a must-have for readers of contemporary poetry.

This year, series editor David Lehman's temperature-taking preface reminds us of Ruth Lilly's colossal $100 million bequest to Poetry Magazine, and notes that you can now collect poet cards and purchase poet swimsuit calendars. The contributors' notes at the back of the book eat up more available pages than usual as they recount what particular works of art or jazz tracks made the authors write their ""best"" poems, while a modest voice indicates that this marks their 8th or 10th appearance in the series. Guest editor Komunyakaa (Neon Vernacular, 1994) argues that the avant-garde, which he terms the ""exploratory"" movement, exists as ""a poetry that borders on cultivated solecism and begs theorists to decipher it"" and that it is ""death in language""; by contrast, the poetry he has chosen ""has content."" Finally, the poems themselves appear; here are fresh gems from Richard Howard, W. S. Merwin, Galway Kinnell (a spectacular threnody on the fall of New York's World Trade Center towers), Carolyn Kizer, Rita Dove, Richard Wilbur, James Tate, Louise Gleck, Philip Levine, C.K. Williams, and the three most recent Pulitzer Prize winners, Stephen Dunn, Carl Dennis and Paul Muldoon. Two other poets stand out-Amy Gerstler contributes an amusing Gilda Radner-like piece about misreading a mailer that wants to send her ""Beethoven's Greatest Symphonies,"" while Ruth Stone (b. 1915) gives the proceedings a suitably youthful air with her speculative ""Lines"": ""Voice, perhaps you are the universe;/ the hum of spiders."" Nowhere near as lively as last year's Robert Creeley-edited compilation, the 16th edition of this annual has pleasures of its own. (Oct.) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.","2003","5"
"The Best American Poetry 2008","Charles Wright","9780743299756","The Best American Poetry series is a beloved mainstay of American poetry. This year's edition was edited by one of the most admired and acclaimed poets of his generation, Charles Wright. Known for his meditative and beautiful observations of landscape, change, and time,Wright brings his particular sensibility to this year's anthology, which contains an ecumenical slant that is unprecedented for the series. He has gathered an astonishing selection of work that includes new poems by Carolyn Forché, Jorie Graham, Louise Glück, Frank Bidart, Frederick Seidel, Patti Smith, and Kevin Young and showcases a dazzling array of rising stars like Joshua Beckman, Erica Dawson, and Alex Lemon.With captivating and revelatory notes from the poets on their works and sage and erudite introductory essays by Wright and series editor David Lehman, The Best American Poetry 2008 will be read, discussed, debated, and prized for years to come.Publishers WeeklyIn his bullet-pointed introduction to this year's volume in this popular annual anthology series, prolific Pulitzer winner Wright makes it known that he is interested in emotional intensity, and its capacity to give poems shape and beauty, more than in any particular aesthetic camp: ""cleverness is not what endures. Only pain endures. And the rhythm of pain."" Poems here might be called confessional, hip, avant-garde, edgy and conservative. Powerful if hairy poems by Marvin Bell, Alex Lemon and D. Nurkse are good examples of the range of what Wright likes, as is Rae Armantrout's stark and hurting elegy for Robert Creeley: ""The present is cupped// by a small effort/ of focus-// its muscular surround.// You're left out."" Many of the usual suspects-Ashbery, Glück, Merwin, Graham, Charles Simic-are represented by strong poems. Also here are representatives of the generation now entering mid-career, like D.A. Powell, Natasha Trethewey and Kevin Young. Some of the most exciting poems come from writers whose stars are still rising, such as an extraordinary meditation on love by Mary Szybist: ""The Puritans thought that we are granted the ability to love/ Only through miracle,/ But the troubadours knew how to burn themselves through,/ How to make themselves shrines to their own longing.""

"The Best American Poetry 2009","David Wagoner","9781615521647","David Wagoner writes about regular lives with plain grace and transcendent humanity, and the seventy-five poems he has chosen for the 2009 edition of The Best American Poetry grapple with life, celebrate freedom, and teem with imaginative energy. With engaging notes from the poets, Wagoner's superb introductory essay, series editor David Lehman's astute foreword about the current state of poetry and criticism, and cover art from the beloved poet John Ashbery, The Best American Poetry 2009 is a memorable and delightful addition to a series dedicated to showcasing the work of poets at their best.Publishers WeeklyFrom the moment series editor David Lehman invokes the myth of Jacob wrestling the Angel in his introduction, the gloves are off in this year's installment of this popular annual anthology. Lehman devotes much of his introduction to throwing jabs at longtime sparring partner and professional poetry grump William Logan, whom Lehman calls “wounded” and “thin skinned.” Guest editor Wagoner chooses to abstain from the scuffle, but there's no denying the aesthetic character amassed by the poems he's selected: American poets not only want to talk about their country this year, they want to talk violence in (and toward) their country. “They came to blow up America,” writes John Ashbery, followed hard on his heels by Mark Bibbins, who warns our fifth state, “Connecticut! we're sawing you in half.” Denise Duhamel envisions “How It Will End” (“We look around, but no one is watching us”) and Rob Cook, in his bold and incantatory “Song of America,” tells us, “I'm raising my child to drown and drop dead and to carry buildings on his back.” It appears our poets are at last ready to confront the hysteria and violence of the past eight years, and who can say there's a better year than 2009 to begin.

"The Best American Poetry 2006","Billy Collins","9780743257596","Billy Collins, one of our most beloved poets, has chosen poems of wit, humor, imagination, and surprise, in a range of styles and forms, for The Best American Poetry 2006. The result is a celebration of the pleasures of poetry. In his charming and candid introduction Collins explains how he chose seventy-five poems from among the thousands he considered. With insightful comments from the poets illuminating their work, and series editor David Lehman's thought-provoking foreword, The Best American Poetry 2006 is a brilliant addition to a series that links the most noteworthy verse and prose poems of our time to a readership as discerning as it is devoted to the art of poetry.Publishers WeeklyIn the 19th installment of this annual series, former poet laureate Collins (The Trouble with Poetry, 2005), one of America's most popular poets ever, has culled the typical handful of big names and some surprising new voices from more than 50 American literary publications. Collins's predilections for accessibility, humor and tidy forms are evident, but there are also surprises. Usual suspects former Best American editors Ashbery (who surprises with a poem in neatly rhymed couplets), Hass, Simic, Tate and Muldoon, as well as Mary Oliver meet rising masters like Kay Ryan (""A bird's/ worth of weight/ or one bird-weight/ of Wordsworth""), Vijay Seshadri and Franz Wright. Most interesting, however, is the chance each volume offers to see which up-and-comers make the cut. This year's roster includes edgy poems by Joy Katz, Danielle Pafunda (""my hair cramped with sexy""), Terrance Hayes, and Christian Hawkey (""O my/ beloved shovel-nosed mole""), among others. Collins's surprising and opinionated introduction in which he admits that, unlike some of series editor David Lehman's previous guest editors, ""the designation `best' doesn't bother me,"" and offers his definition of a good poem (often one that ""starts in the factual"" and displays ""a tone of playful irreverence"") may cause some controversy.

"The Best American Poetry 2007","Heather McHugh","9780743299732","The twentieth edition of the Best American Poetry series celebrates the rich and fertile landscape of American poetry. Renowned poet Heather McHugh loves words and the unexpected places they take you; her own poetry elevates wordplay to a species of metaphysical wit. For this year's anthology McHugh has culled a spectacular group of poems reflecting her passion for language, her acumen, and her vivacious humor.Graced with McHugh's fascinating introduction, the book includes the poets' valuable comments on their work, as well as series editor David Lehman's engaging foreword that limns the necessity of poetry. The Best American Poetry 2007 is an exciting addition to a series committed to covering the American poetry scene and delivering great poems to a broad audience.Publishers WeeklyThe 20th volume in America's most popular annual poetry anthology series is perhaps the most esoteric. McHugh, an unusual poet herself, who says she is ""Fond of the textures of a text, the matter of a letter,"" has tried to assemble what she feels is a cohesive anthology rather than simply a gathering of favorite poems from this past year's literary magazines. As ever, some familiar names-former editors and famous poets-appear: John Ashbery, Billy Collins (""Who has time for sunlight falling on the city""), Robert Creeley, Louise Glück, Robert Hass, Robert Pinsky, Galway Kinnell. But there are also a number of representatives, such as Rae Armantrout and Christian Bök (""selves we woo/ we lose// losses we levee/ we owe""), from off-center traditions. A few of the newbies tend toward the experimental, such as Ben Lerner and Danielle Pafunda: ""Do he &amp; he have a big muscle in the arm from the aiming?"" All and all, this is a riskier than usual volume, though also full of familiar pleasures. Certainly it attests to poetry's continuing vitality.

"Blacklegs, Card Sharps, and Confidence Men","Thomas Ruys Smith","9780807136362","In 1836 Benjamin Drake, a midwestern writer of popular sketches for newspapers of the day, introduced his readers to a new and distinctly American rascal who rode the steamboats up and down the Mississippi and other western waterwaysùthe riverboat gambler. These men, he recorded, ôdress with taste and elegance; carry gold chronometers in their pockets; and swear with the most genteel precision. . . . Every where throughout the valley, these mistletoe gentry are called by the original, if not altogether classic, cognomen of æBlack-legs.AÆö In Blacklegs, Card Sharps, and Confidence Men, Thomas Ruys Smith collects nineteenth-century stories, sketches, and book excerpts by a gallery of authors to create a comprehensive collection of writings about the riverboat gambler. Long an iconic figure in American myth and popular culture but, strangely, one that has never until now received a book-length treatment, the Mississippi River gambler was a favorite character throughout the nineteenth centuryùone often rich with moral ambiguities that remain unresolved to this day. In the absorbing fictional and nonfictional accounts of high stakes and sudden reversals of fortune found in the pages of SmithAÆs book, the voices of canonized writers such as William Dean Howells, Herman Melville, and, of course, Mark Twain hold prominent positions. But they mingle seamlessly with lesser-known pieces such as an excerpt from Edward WillettAÆs sensationalistic dime novel Flush FredAÆs Full Hand, raucous sketches by anonymous Old Southwestern humorists from the Spirit of the Times, and colorful accounts by now nearly forgotten authors such as Daniel R. Hundley and George W. Featherstonhaugh. Smith puts the twenty-eight selections in perspective with an Introduction that thoroughly explores the history and myth surrounding this endlessly fascinating American cultural icon. While the riverboat gambler may no longer ply his trade along the Mississippi, Blacklegs, Card Sharps, and Confidence Men makes clear the ways in which he still operates quite successfully in the American imagination.","2010","8"

"The Portable Jack Kerouac","Jack Kerouac","9780143105060","The definitive Kerouac collection-now in Penguin Classics To coincide with the 50th anniversary celebration of On the Road, Penguin Classics republishes this landmark collection. The Portable Jack Kerouac made clear the ambition and accomplishment of Kerouac's ""Legend of Duluoz""-the story of his life told in his many ""true story"" novels. Featuring selections from Kerouac's autobiographical fiction, as well as from his poetry, criticism, Buddhist writings, and letters, The Portable Jack Kerouac offers a total immersion in an American master.Publishers WeeklyMuch as Viking's Portable William Faulkner rekindled interest in Faulkner because his editor, Malcolm Cowley, had the brainstorm of pulling together a map of Faulkner's epic Yoknapatawpha County series of novels and stories in order to give the work a new coherence, so Kerouac gains new stature as a result of labors by his biographer, Charters (Kerouac: A Biography). Here she chronologically excerpts the perhaps 16 volumes of the Legend of Duluoz to create a map of Kerouac's oeuvre, which, according to the publisher, he had planned before his death. She supports it not only with fat slices of Kerouac's best writing but also with an investigation into his bop prosody that gives his jazz-riff style a new currency. In fact, this volume may deal a fist in the face of the English sentence, because Kerouac's revamping of the sentence is so song-filled and emotion-ridden that its properties could well do for American prose what Whitman did for verse: give it new life. An alcoholic jamming by candlelight with scotch and pot on the kitchen table, he mixes jazz with Rimbaud's derangement of the senses to create a vehicle for his own anguish as he recollects his life on the run. The Portable shows Kerouac at his best as a riff artist but also gathers to stronger effect than any single Kerouac novel. Includes selections from his poetry and experimental novels.

"Age Ain't Nothing But a Number: Black Women Explore Midlife","Carleen Brice","9780807028230","Finally, a collection that celebrates, considers, contemplates, even criticizes'midlife' from a black woman's point of view. Age Ain't Nothing but a Number ranges over every aspect of black women's lives: personal growth, family and friendship, love and sexuality, health, beauty, illness, spirituality, creativity, financial independence, work, and scores of other topics.Midlife today isn't your grandmother's'change of life.' Today, black women call hot flashes 'power surges,' and menopause, the 'pause that refreshes.' These days, middle-aged women may be newlyweds or new mothers, as well as grandmothers or widows. They may experience the empty-nest syndrome and then the 'return-to-the-nest syndrome' as adult children move back home. They may navigate the field of Internet dating, travel the world, teach homeless women, take up pottery, or study international business.This anthology captures all of these aspects of midlife as experienced by some of the finest voices in African-American writing today. Featuring the work of Maya Angelou, J. California Cooper, Pearl Cleage, Nikki Giovanni, Susan L. Taylor, Alice Walker, and dozens of others, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number will make readers think, laugh, and cry and will be the perfect gift book for spring.Library JournalIn this anthology of essays, plus some fiction and poetry, 41 African American women share their sometimes humorous and sometimes painful experiences with middle age. Divided into four sections-""A New Attitude,"" ""New Bones,"" ""Roots,"" and ""In Search of Satisfaction""-these works focus on relationships, health, spirituality, and other relevant topics. An English professor throws a ball rather than a party in honor of her 50th birthday, a poet says good-bye to her monthly cycle, two doctors discuss menopause myths, a broadcast journalist tells of the joys of adoption, and a woman's health activist comments on safe sex among seniors. Such writers as Nikki Giovanni, Diane Donaldson, Miriam Decosta-Willis, and Maya Angelou speak of the fear of aging, dealing with breast reduction surgery, facing the death of a spouse, and finding romance. Whether these women are celebrating or bemoaning the process of growing old, the result is a wonderful compilation.

The Awards are the magazine equivalents to the Pulitzer Prizes of the newspaper industry. Each year, hundreds of editors-in-chief, journalism professors, and art directors winnow more than a thousand submissions to about seventy-five nominees in categories such as Reporting, Feature Writing, Profiles, Public Interest, Essays, Reviews and Criticism. Interest in the nominees is keen, and this collection will allow people both in the magazine world and beyond to find in one place, read, and admire the year's best. It is a wonderful, browsable volume of interest to writers and readers who appreciate magazine writing and journalism at its highest level. The American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) is the professional organization for senior editors of consumer magazines and business publications which are edited, published, and sold in the United States. It sponsors the National Magazine Awards which are administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. KLIATTWhat a good idea this is! This collection reprints winners of the National Magazine Award sponsored by the American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME). Since this anthology emphasizes reporting and analysis, there is no overlap with the older series The Best American Essays, which emphasizes the personal essay. In another refreshing choice, the book contains only one celebrity interview, a genre that dominates so many of our magazines. Some of the essays are horrifying: Richard Preston's piece on smallpox, Vanity Fair reports on torture and genocide in Yugoslavia, and the longest essay in the book, Kenneth Cain's report on the civil war in Liberia. Others are touching, including Gary Smith's Sports Illustrated rumination on a photograph taken in the Texas Christian University locker room minutes before the 1957 Cotton Bowl. In all the reportorial pieces, precise detail and intelligent analysis are evident, none more so than in Bryan Hayes's fascinating piece from The Sciences on the elaborate astronomical clock of the Strasbourg Cathedral, an essay subtitled ""When one millennium's bright ideas become inscrutable legacies for the next."" The winners also include three excellent short stories, all from The New Yorker, including a funny and moving story of sexual frustration, ""The Barber's Unhappiness"" by George Saunders, and Jhumpa Lahiri's charming story of Bengali immigrants to London, ""The Third and Final Continent."" Another category represented here is movie and book reviews. Teenage readers might be especially interested in Tom Carson's critique of Saving Private Ryan, first published in Esquire. Young people, especially those who don't regularly read general interest magazines,will find some intriguing surprises here. The ASME hopes to make this collection of prizewinners an annual event. Long may the series flourish. KLIATT Codes: SARecommended for senior high school students, advanced students, and adults. 2000, Perseus/Public Affairs, 400p, notes, 21cm, 00-057583, $14.00.

"American Fantastic Tales: Terror and the Uncanny from the 1940s to Now","Peter Straub","9781598530483","The second volume of Peter Straub's pathbreaking two-volume anthology American Fantastic Tales picks up the story in 1940 and provides persuasive evidence that the decades since then have seen an extraordinary flowering. While continuing to explore the classic themes of horror and fantasy, successive generations of writersincluding Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, Charles Beaumont, Stephen King, Steven Millhauser, and Thomas Ligottihave opened up the field to new subjects, new styles, and daringly fresh expansions of the genre's emotional and philosophical underpinnings. For many of these writers, the fantastic is simply the best available tool for describing the dislocations and newly hatched terrors of the modern era, from the nightmarish post-apocalyptic savagery of Harlan Ellison's ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"" to proliferating identities set deliriously adrift in Tim Powers' ""Pat Moore."" ""At its core,"" writes editor Peter Straub, ""the fantastic is a way of seeing."" In place of gothic trappings, the post-war masters of the fantastic often substitute an air of apparent normality. The surfaces of American lifedepartment store displays in John Collier's ""Evening Primrose,"" tar-paper roofs seen from an el train in Fritz Leiber's ""Smoke Ghost,"" the balcony of a dilapidated movie theater in Tennessee Williams' ""The Mysteries of the Joy Rio""become invested with haunting presences. The sphere of family life is transformed, in Davis Grubb's ""Where the Woodbine Twineth"" or Richard Matheson's ""Prey,"" into an arena of eerie menace. Dramas of madness, malevolent temptation, and vampiristic appropriation play themselves out against the backdrop of modern urban life in John Cheever's ""Torch Song"" and Shirley Jackson's unforgettable ""The Daemon Lover."" Nearly half the stories collected in this volume were published in the last two decades, including work by Michael Chabon, M. Rickert, Brian Evenson, Kelly Link, and Benjamin Percy: writers for whom traditional genre boundaries have ceased to exist, and who have brought the fantastic into the mainstream of contemporary writing. The 42 stories in this second volume of American Fantastic Tales provide an irresistible journey into the phantasmagoric underside of the American imagination.Publishers WeeklyStarred Review. In this second installment, Straub ventures onto somewhat more adventurous ground. His selections bring readers completely up to date with the genre, featuring tales from even the newest writers, such as M. Rickert and Joe Hill. This thorough anthology is likely to replace Fraser and Wise's 1944 Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural as a lib. It foreshadows the careers of writers who may very well turn out to be classics. Straub's reach is admirably broad, bringing to light worthy but under the radar talents such as Jane Rice and Jack Snow, both pulp writers who flourished briefly at the beginning of the ""modern"" era. Yet, he leaves room for the more mainstream writers: Jerome Bixby, Donald Wandrei, Fritz Leiber, Richard Matheson, and Poppy Z. Brite alongside Shirley Jackson, Paul Bowles, Joy Carol Oates, and Truman Capote. Straub incorporates such writers with originality: choosing, for example, to use Tennessee Williams' ""The Mysteries of the Joy Rio"" for once rather than his more common ""The Vengeance of Nitocris."" The anthology has genuinely imaginative writing and editorial vision. Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","2009","4"

"Growing up Poor: A Literary Anthology","Robert Coles","9781565847446","A searingly candid look at growing up ""without,"" edited by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the Children of Crisis series. In a land of seemingly endless plenty, Growing Up Poor offers a startling and beautiful collection of stories, poems, and essays about growing up without. Searing in their candor, understated, and often unexpectedly moving, the selections range from a young girl's story of coming of age in the slums of New York at the turn of the twentieth century and a southern family's struggles during the Depression, to contemporary stories of urban and rural poverty by some of our foremost authors. Divided into four thematically organized sections (on the material circumstances of poverty, denigration at the hands of others, the working poor, and moments of resolve and resiliency), the book mixes the work of experienced authorsmany of whom write autobiographically about poverty they have experienced first-handwith the work of students and other contemporary writers. Edited and with an introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning child psychiatrist Robert Coles, Growing Up Poor gives eloquent voice to those judged not by who they are, but by what they lack.

"Great American Prose Poems","David Lehman","9780743243506","A prose poem is a poem written in prose rather than verse. But what does that really mean? Is it an indefinable hybrid?

"Bordering Fires: The Vintage Book of Contemporary Mexican and Chicano/a Literature","Cristina Garcia","9781400077182","As the descendants of Mexican immigrants have settled throughout the United States, a great literature has emerged, but its correspondances with the literature of Mexico have gone largely unobserved. In Bordering Fires, the first anthology to combine writing from both sides of the Mexican-U.S. border, Cristina Garc’a presents a richly diverse cross-cultural conversation. Beginning with Mexican masters such as Alfonso Reyes and Juan Rulfo, Garc’a highlights historic voices such as “the godfather of Chicano literature” Rudolfo Anaya, and Gloria Anzaldœa, who made a powerful case for language that reflects bicultural experience. From the fierce evocations of Chicano reality in Jimmy Santiago Baca’s Poem IX to the breathtaking images of identity in Coral Bracho’s poem “Fish of Fleeting Skin,” from the work of Carlos Fuentes to Sandra Cisneros, Ana Castillo to Octavio Paz, this landmark collection of fiction, essays, and poetry offers an exhilarating new vantage point on our continent–and on the best of contemporary literature.Library JournalThe timeliness of this work cannot be questioned, since it features essays, fiction, and poetry that reflect the formidable physical and psychological boundary between the United States and Mexico. Editor Garc a (Dreaming in Cuban) contends that the border has shaped artistic expression on both sides; these selections suggest the frustration Latinos face as they ambulate between two cultures. Gloria Anzald a's ""How To Tame a Wild Tongue"" describes the bilingual acrobatics executed by many Latinos, Rub n Mart nez's ""Crossing Over"" narrates the travails of the border, and Richard Rodriguez's ""India"" offers an unflinching view on the issue of miscegenation. Of equal importance, however, is the Mexican literature that preceded contemporary Latino writing. For this reason, Garc a includes selections from distinguished Mexican writers (e.g., Rulfo, Paz, Poniatowska, Monsiv is, Fuentes, and many others) whose work has both reflected and influenced the Mexican psyche. In this sense, the book serves as an important sampling of Mexico's best authors. Although similar to the recent Mexico: A Traveler's Literary Companion, which helps the traveler understand Mexico, this new work helps Mexico and the United States understand the traveler from and between these two worlds.

The authors analyze how the diasporic lived experience of Puerto Ricans is played out in the context of class, race, gender, and sexuality and how other themes emerging from postcolonialism and postmodernism come into play. Their critical work also demonstrates an understanding of how the process of migration and the relations between Puerto Rico and the United States complicate notions of cultural and national identity as writers confront their bilingual, bicultural, and transnational realities.The collection has considerable breadth and depth. It covers earlier, undertheorized writers, prominent writers, and often-neglected writers.

It is a rich, capacious volume, featuring the work of more than 200 poets-almost three times as many as the 1976 edition. With a succinct and often witty head note introducing each author, it is certain to become the definitive anthology of American poetry for our time.Lehman has gathered together all the works one would expect to find in a landmark collection of American poetry, from Whitman's Crossing Brooklyn Ferry to Stevens's The Idea of Order at Key West, and from Eliot's The Waste Land to Ashbery's Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. But equally important, the editor has significantly expanded the range of the anthology. The book includes not only writers born since the previous edition, but also many fine poets overlooked in earlier editions or little known in the past but highly deserving of attention. The anthology confers legitimacy on the Objectivist poets; the so-called Proletariat poets of the 1930s; famous poets who fell into neglect or were the victims of critical backlash (Edna St. Vincent Millay); poets whose true worth has only become clear with the passing of time (Weldon Kees). Among poets missing from Richard Ellmann's 1976 volume but published here are W. H. Auden, Charles Bukowski, Donald Justice, Carolyn Kizer, Kenneth Koch, Stanley Kunitz, Emma Lazarus, Mina Loy, Howard Moss, Lorine Niedecker, George Oppen, James Schuyler, Elinor Wylie, and Louis Zukosky.

There are experimental and innovative works that stretch and re-imagine our expectations about theatre. There's a hilarious and profane comedy that looks danger squarely in the eye and spits at it; a wise and touching piece composed of five interlocking monologues that gradually reveal profound truths; and a moving and insightful drama that points hopefully and heroically toward a renewed faith in the principles on which our country was founded.Community News Publications of Delaware - Paula ShulakThere are two verse plays included which is unusual in and of itself, but the excellence of their poetry also is astounding. The Death of King Arthur by Matthew Freeman is a masterful rewriting of the familiar Camelot story which depicts in a totally new way the psyches of the characters we know so well. ...Equally well done is J. Scott Reynolds' poetic version of another classic, this time a novel by Balzac. The Wild Ass s Skin is easy to read, thought provoking and contains some of the cleverest comic verse that I have read. A morality play of the highest order, we learn a lesson as we laugh. ...I thoroughly enjoyed The Resurrectionist by Kate Chell and Summerland by Brian Thorstenson. The former takes place in 17th Century England when it was commonplace for grave robbers to sell bodies to doctors for the study of the new science of anatomy. This fascinating topic is the background for the coming of age tale of a strong young woman whose plight unfolds before us. (Incidentally this script reads very well which is not always the case since plays are written to be performed.) Summerland is also about coming of age, but in the entirely different modern setting of rugged South Dakota. It presents a young man learning about his manhood with the firm guidance of his pioneer great grandmother in the background. ...  Match by Marc Chun should really be seen to be fully appreciated but the ability of its author shines through even on paper. It is a brilliant juxtaposition of four subplots with an ingenious interweaving of lines from the four stories going on simultaneously. It is almost too difficult to describe but onstage it must be nothing short of miraculous I am sure. What an impact this show must have! Add to that the fact that the play deals beautifully with the questioning of life and death, especially after September 11, and you have a recipe for sure success. Finally, the play entitled Reality by Curtiss I Cook is my favorite. An all black cast adds to the impact of this fascinating look at the question of what is real? The internal twists and turns of the plot keep the audience (or the reader) on their toes as we delve back and forth between two or three kinds of reality and replay the same scenes two or three times until they are right . There is a strong message here which is worth waiting for and you are engrossed in the action from beginning to end.","2002","1"
"The New World Border: Prophecies, Poems, and Loqueras for the End of the Century","Guillermo Gomez-Pena","9780872863132","Poetry. Latin American Studies. THE NEW WORLD BORDER is a new collection of essays, poems, and performance text through which Gomez-Pena muses on matters of race, nationality, language, and identity. The book is a carnivalesque inversion of ethnic and geo-political ideology, a disorienting free-fall into the space between cultures, and a head-on collision with real and imagined borders. Gomez-Pena won international acclaim for his efforts to create a hybrid culture and articulate a borderless ethos, and has been called an intercultural interpreter, reverse anthropologist, experimental linguist, and political artist of the first order. The Village Voice proclaims ""In everything he does, he remains an indomitably playful phrasemaker; a fertile rethinker of contradictions, clichés, and conundrums; and an inspiring recruiter for a playground army of cultural pluralists"".","2001","5"

"A Whole Other Ball Game: Women's Literature on Women's Sport","Joli Sandoz","9780374525217","Since the late 1800s, women have repeatedly proven their fitness for competitive sport...simply by playing the game. Any game. Off court and on; despite all opposition. A literary first, A Whole Other Ball Game deals with all aspects of women's competitive sports, from the thrill of winning before hometown fans to the interpersonal dynamics on a team. This engaging collection of short stories, poems, and novel excerpts tells the exciting story of women's sports from the sportswoman's own point of view.Joli Sandoz has played, coached, and written about competitive athletics since her first plunge from the starting blocks in 1961. Her sporting credits include working as the first woman track coach at Harvard. She teaches American Studies at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.Kirkus ReviewsAmerican women, editor Sandoz observes, have long had a ""fierce love of sport"": In 1866, Vassar College already fielded two women's baseball teams. That love, based on the evidence of these mostly contemporary stories, poems, and novel excerpts, has produced some energetic, thoughtful explorations of the liberating possibilities of sport for women. Many of the pieces here deal with the struggles of womenespecially adolescentstrying to accept that competition is good, that winning is even better, and that it's possible to be both a woman and an athlete without slighting either. Stephanie Grant's story ""Posting-Up"" offers a tough- minded description of the manner in which her adolescent narrator discovers the exhilaration of playing basketball well and aggressively. ""Scotti Scores,"" by Jane Gilliland, carries the idea a step further, exploring how the members of a high-school hockey team astonish themselves and their coach by cooperating to outplay a far more experienced team. Stories by Laurie Colwin, Ellen Gilchrist, Sara Maitland, and Jennifer Levin are particularly strong, as are the excerpts from novels by Carol Anshaw and Sara Vogan. Some tales suffer from seeming too programmatic, too thin and message-laden. But, overall, a useful introduction to an overlooked area in contemporary fiction and poetry.","1997","9"

"Writing New England: An Anthology from the Puritans to the Present","Andrew Delbanco","9780674006034","The story of New England writing begins some 400 years ago, when a group of English Puritans crossed the Atlantic believing that God had appointed them to bring light and truth to the New World. Over the centuries since, the people of New England have produced one of the great literary traditions of the world--an outpouring of poetry, fiction, history, memoirs, letters, and essays that records how the original dream of a godly commonwealth has been both sustained and transformed into a modern secular culture enriched by people of many backgrounds and convictions.  Writing New England, edited by the literary scholar and critic Andrew Delbanco, is the most comprehensive anthology of this tradition, offering a full range of thought and style. The major figures of New England literature--from John Winthrop and Anne Bradstreet to Emerson, Hawthorne, Dickinson, and Thoreau, to Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton, and John Updike--are of course represented, often with fresh and less familiar selections from their works. But Writing New England also samples a wide range of writings including Puritan sermons, court records from the Salem witch trials, Felix Frankfurter's account of the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, William Apess's eulogy for the Native American King Philip, pamphlets and poems of the Revolution and the Civil War, natural history, autobiographical writings of W. E. B. Du Bois and Malcolm X, Mary Antin's account of the immigrant experience, John F. Kennedy's broadcast address on civil rights, and A. Bartlett Giamatti's memoir of a Red Sox fan.  Organized thematically, this anthology provides a collective self-portrait of the New England mind. With an introductory essay on the origins of New England, a detailed chronology, and explanatory headnotes for each selection, the book is a welcoming introduction to a great American literary tradition and a treasury of vivid writing that defines what it has meant, over nearly four centuries, to be a New Englander.Publishers WeeklyDespite the proliferation of regional studies, particularly of the American South, there are relatively few collections of or studies about New England writing. Perhaps it's because New England was the original region. Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry James are not generally considered New Englanders so much as Americans. Delbanco, a renowned scholar of the Puritan experience in America (author of The Puritan Ordeal), wants to call attention to the fact that these writers were not simply from New England but of it. In this beautifully conceived collection, Delbanco has interspersed with unchallenged figures such as Thoreau and Hawthorne a few pieces that have been all but lost to the general reading public. William Apess, for example, is represented by an excerpt from his 1836 Eulogy on King Philip, chastising white for dispossessing Native Americans. Apess was a New Englander of Indian descent who became a Methodist preacher and eventually joined the Mashpee Indians on Cape Cod, leading a rebellion against their white overseers: ""And while you ask yourselves, 'What do they, the Indians, want?' you have only to look at the unjust laws made for them and say, 'They want what I want.' "" In his introduction, Delbanco sounds the ""keynote"" of the original New England identity as ""the throbbing heart of Christianity in the New World."" As the new Eden did not fulfill itself, he concludes, New Englanders began an ""inward turn toward self-admonition [which] is the hallmark of what Henry James called 'the New England conscience.' "" This is an excellent gathering of letters, poems, stories, essays and excerpts from novels and histories. (Sept.) Copyright 2001 Cahners BusinessInformation.","2001","9"

This volume brings together the work of thirty distinguished poets to convey the vitality and variety of the region's poetic creation during much of the twentieth century. Henry Lyman has selected the poets, arranged their work chronologically by birth date, and written a brief preface to each section. The anthology is by no means comprehensive, nor is it an attempt to establish a ""canon"" of New England poets. Rather it is simply a selection of notable poems chosen for their clarity, depth, and common ground. The poems converse with each other from page to page, resulting in a cohesive, eminently readable text. For the student or general reader, there is no better introduction to the range and richness of New England poetry.","1996","8"

"Boricuas: Influential Puerto Rican Writings--- An Anthology","Roberto Santiago","9780345395023","MANY CULTURES • ONE WORLD""Boricua is what Puerto Ricans call one another as a term of endearment, respect, and cultural affirmation; it is a timeless declaration that transcends gender and color. Boricua is a powerful word that tells the origin and history of the Puerto Rican people.""From the Introduction From the sun-drenched beaches of a beautiful, flamboyan-covered island to the cool, hard pavement of the fierce South Bronx, the remarkable journey of the Puerto Rican people is a rich story full of daring defiance, courageous strength, fierce passions, and dangerous politicsand it is a story that continues to be told today. Long ignored by Anglo literature studies, here are more than fifty selections of poetry, fiction, plays, essays, monologues, screenplays, and speeches from some of the most vibrant and original voices in Puerto Rican literature. * Jack Agüeros • Miguel Algarín • Julia de Burgos • Pedro Albizu Campos • Lucky CienFuegos • Judith Ortiz Cofer • Jesus Colon • Victor Hern ndez Cruz • José de Diego • Martin Espada • Sandra Maria Esteves • Ronald Fernandez • José Luis Gonzalez • Migene Gonzalez-Wippler • Maria Graniela de Pruetzel • Pablo Guzman • Felipe Luciano • René Marqués • Luis Muñoz Marín • Nicholasa Mohr • Aurora Levins Morales • Martita Morales • Rosario Morales • Willie Perdomo • Pedro Pietri • Miguel Piñero • Reinaldo Povod • Freddie Prinze • Geraldo Rivera • Abraham Rodriguez, Jr. • Clara E.

Vasquez • Ana Lydia VegaPublishers WeeklyWhile it could have been more strictly organized (i.e., vaguely thematic chapters include ``History and Politics'' and ``Anxiety and Assimilation,'' currents present in almost every piece), this excellent anthology of essays, fiction, poetry, screenplays and other works by writers of Puerto Rican heritage shimmers with interesting reading. In a buoyant introduction, Santiago describes his own, youthful discovery of Puerto Rican writers-``the first book I read by a Puerto Rican author was the one the Jesuits at Xavier had denounced as pornographic and prejudiced against whites. I knew it had to be good''-and explains why their writing continues to feel ``subversive.'' Jesus Colon fluidly combines a thumbnail history of the island's oppression with an explanation of why it takes a lot of effort before a Puerto Rican will ``ask you to have a cup of black coffee with him in his own kitchen.'' In ``Palante! Young Lords,'' Pablo Guzman recounts the founding of the Young Lords Party, based on the Black Panthers. With academic clarity, Clara E. Rodriguez examines racial background in ``Puerto Ricans: Between Black and White,'' a theme Julia de Burgos treats more succinctly and emotionally in poetry. Women are well represented here, although they tend to write about being women specifically. In general, the variety is impressive: Ana Lydia Vega, Martin Espada, Geraldo Rivera, a transcript of a Freddie Prinze monologue and a serious essay by the comedian's mother. Santiago has gracefully managed to pull together a collection that presents a united front while perserving the diversity of the individual voices. (Sept.)","1995","2"
"Thousand and One Afternoons in Chicago","Ben Hecht","9780226322742","In 1921, Ben Hecht wrote a column for the Chicago Daily News that his editor called “journalism extraordinary; journalism that invaded the realm of literature.” Hecht’s collection of sixty-four of these pieces, illustrated with striking pen drawings by Herman Rosse, is a timeless caricature of urban American life in the jazz age, updated with a new Introduction for the twenty-first century. From the glittering opulence of Michigan Avenue to the darkest ruminations of an escaped convict, from captains of industry to immigrant day laborers, Hecht captures 1920s Chicago in all its furor, intensity, and absurdity.“The columns in 1,001 Afternoons in Chicago are scruffy time capsules of an earlier Chicago, an era that is long gone but still recognizable to readers' imaginations. Michigan Avenue, Lake Michigan, street names such as Dearborn and Adams and LaSalle and Wabansia, places such as the Art Institute of Chicago—they're all here, sprinkled amid Hecht's nervous little haikus of urban life. He calls Chicago ‘a razzle-dazzle of dreams, tragedies, fantasies,’ and his tales capture gorgeous scraps of it, vivid vignettes starring businessmen and hobos and cops and socialites and janitors. . . . Thanks to Hecht, the Chicago of 1922 and the Chicago of 2009 bump into each other, shake hands, exchange greetings. Then, this being Chicago, they go for a drink and talk about old times. New ones too.”—Julia Keller, Chicago Tribune“The hardboiled audacity and wit that became Hecht’s signature as Hollywood’s most celebrated screen-writer are conspicuous in these vignettes.

"El Coro","Martin Espada","9781558491113","El Coro offers proof that Latino/a poetry today is more complex and diverse, more beautiful and powerful, than had been previously acknowledged. Here we find the open expression of anger and grief, self-mocking humor, the music of protest, the quiet assertion of dignity, and the raucous celebration of survival. There are poems about stoop labor and welfare offices and housing projects, but also poems about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the Minotaur. Among the poets are former farm workers and gang members, a practicing physician, an ex-tenant lawyer, two professional chefs, and a Vietnam veteran. One poet was a political prisoner for six years; another staged a famous hunger strike; still another was indicted for her work with Central American refugees. In many ways this collection of poets comprises a chorus. Their song humanizes in the face of dehumanization.Library JournalEspada (English, Univ. of Massachusetts) has compiled a successful assortment of 43 Latino poets writing in English, unusual in that a high number live in New England. To eschew favoritism, he arranged an entire generation of contributors alphabetically, mixing well-established names like Gary Soto with several younger lesser-knowns. A mixture of styles is also included: sonnets, prose poems, and concrete poetry are all here. Although most of the selections were previously published locally, their treatment of the themes of the Latino experience, the indignity of racism, and the quest for the preservation of cultural identity make them deserving of a wider audience. Julio Marzan sums it up the best: ""Next spring I will be/ Forty years a foreigner."" Espada, himself a poet of some renown (Imagine the Angels of Bread, LJ 6/1/96) and a contributor to this volume, has provided a good, useful vehicle for disseminating that broader cultural awareness.

"30 Satires","Lewis H. Lapham","9781565849860","Now in paperback, a leading political satirist skewers the pretensions of America's equestrian classes.Publishers WeeklyReaders of Harper's magazine will likely recognize many of these dispatches from editor Lapham, examining roughly two decades of political and cultural folly. Many essays have aged well, but others have not; a reimagining of A Christmas Carol (Scrooge returns to his miserly self, an ending more in tune with the Contract with America) is loaded to capacity with mid-'90s topical references, and the very subjects of some chapters have faded into obscurity. The analysis of Steve Forbes's political career, for example, is amusing, but may leave readers struggling to recall the candidacy it describes. Every page offers at least one clever turn of phrase and at least one scornful appraisal of people, like the ""self-appointed guardians of the nation's conscience"" from academia who ""wish to be consulted on matters that almost none of them understand."" But those who recognize satire primarily in its farcical vein may wonder at some chapters. Is it really satire to point out that media coverage of the deaths of Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr. was ridiculously overblown, or that Rudy Giuliani's attack on the Brooklyn Museum of Art was glaring political opportunism? It is: satire requires only that vice and absurdity be held up to contempt and ridicule, both of which Lapham supplies in erudite abundance. In one essay, he mentions Voltaire, Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce. The entire book displays the skill with which he follows in their footsteps, and in another 20 years, one might expect its better chapters to be held in similar regard. (Nov.)

"Paradise Road: Jack Kerouac's Lost Highway and My Search for America","Jay Atkinson","9780470237694","More than fifty years after its publication, Jack Kerouac's iconic novel On the Road remains one of the most important books of the twentieth century. Chronicling Kerouac's adventures as he traveled across North America with his companions Neal Cassady, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and other members of the Beat Generation, On the Road takes a unique look at a lost postwar America. In Paradise Road, Jay Atkinson sets out to re-create Kerouac's journeys of the late 1940s, depicting the travels of the author and his longtime friends as they retrace the five major trips Jack Kerouac took with his pals. Writing with a novelist's eye and ear, Atkinson creates a compelling portrait of North America: its roaring blues bars and nightclubs, empty country roads, and remote prairie towns and byways as well as the enduring warmth and humor of its citizens. Jay Atkinson grew up in Methuen, Massachusetts, a few miles from Jack Kerouac's hometown of Lowell. In this book, Atkinson compares his experiences with those of his former ""neighbor,"" detailing how the country has changed since Kerouac's time. But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this book is the various ways in which the small towns of America have remained the same. Bringing to mind the writing of Kerouac, Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, and Jack London, Atkinson's narrative is a celebration of ordinary American towns and the extraordinary people who reside there. Like Kerouac, Atkinson finds his journey interrupted, changed, and enriched by people he meets along the way?—a barmaid who struggles to quit drinking on the job, a wizened bus driver laboring to fix his car and drive his wife to her cancer treatment, and the former college basketball star who still lives with his ex-girlfriend because neither of them can afford to live alone. Paradise Road takes you on a fascinating, complex, and revealing American journey.","2010","0"
"Baseball: A Literary Anthology","Nicholas Dawidoff","9781931082099","Robert Frost never felt more at home than when watching baseball, ""be it in park or sand lot."" Full of heroism and heartbreak, the most beloved of American sports is also the most poetic, and writers have been drawn to this sports as no other. With Baseball: A Literary Anthology, The Library of America presents the story of the national adventure as revealed through the fascinating lens of the great American game.  Philip Roth considers the terrible thrill of the adolescent centerfielder; Richard Ford listens to minor-league baseball on the radio while driving cross-country; Amiri Baraka remembers the joy of watching the Newark Eagles play in the era before Jackie Robinson shattered the color line. Unforgettable portraits of legendary players who have become icons -- Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Hank Aaron -- are joined by glimpses of lesser-known characters such as the erudite Moe Berg, who could speak a dozen languages ""but couldn't hit in any of them.""  Poems in Baseball: A Literary Anthology include indispensable works whose phrases have entered the language -- Ernest Thayer's ""Casey at the Bat"" and Franklin P. Adams's ""Baseball's Sad Lexicon"" -- as well as more recent offerings from May Swenson, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Martin Espada. Testimonies from classic oral histories offer insights into the players who helped enshrine the sport in the American imagination. Spot reporting by Heywood Broun and Damon Runyan stands side by side with journalistic profiles that match baseball legends with some of our finest writers: John Updike on Ted Williams, Gay Talese on Joe DiMaggio, Red Smith on Lefty Grove.Library JournalDawidoff, the author of a well-regarded biography of Moe Berg (The Catcher Was a Spy), has assembled this collection of exemplary baseball writing. While acknowledging the literature's formative years with early boosters such as Albert Spalding and other ""dead ball"" era writers, he concentrates on its mature period, from Ring Lardner through the two Rogers (Kahn and Angell) of the modern era, even Don Delillo and Stephen King. Dawidoff smartly doesn't rule out a great piece of baseball writing merely because it's familiar: classics like Updike's account of Ted Williams's final 1960 game, Gay Talese's Esquire profile of the unknowable Joe DiMaggio, and W.C. Heinz's salute to the recklessly brave Pistol Pete Reiser belong in any anthology worth its pitching rosin.

"Literary Austin","Don Graham","9780875653426","Don Graham brings together the history, color, and character of Texas's capital city since 1839 when it was selected, on the advice of Mirabeau B. Lamar, as the site for a new capital of the then-Republic of Texas.Essays, fiction, and poetry reveal the variety of literary responses to Austin through the decades and are organized in a roughly chronological fashion to reveal the themes, places, and personalities that have defined the life of the city. Austin was always about three things: natural beauty, government, and education; thus, many of the pieces in this volume dwell upon one and sometimes all of these themes. Besides O. Henry, the other most important literary figures in the city's history were J. Frank Dobie, Roy Bedichek, and Walter P. Webb: folklorist, naturalist, historian. During their heyday, from the 1930s through the early 1960s, they were the face of literary culture in the city. They remain a source of interest, pride, and sometimes controversy. Austin is a well-known haven of liberal political activism, represented by such well-known figures as Lyndon B. Johnson, Ralph Yarborough, Ann and David Richards, Liz Carpenter, Willie Morris, John Henry Faulk, and Molly Ivins. The city is also a haven for literary writers, many of whom appear in these pages: Carolyn Osborn, Rolando Hinojosa-Smith, Dagoberto Gilb, Stephen Harrigan, and Lawrence Wright, to name a few. Among the poets, Thomas Whitbread, Dave Oliphant, David Wevill, and Christopher Middleton have long been on the scene. Certain sites recur-the University Tower, Barton Springs, various watering holes of another kind-so that anybody who has ever spent time in Austin will experience twinges of nostalgia for vanished icons, closed-down venues, and long-gone sites of pleasure brought to life once again, in these pages.Tom Dodge, - The Dallas Morning NewsMr. Graham has developed, via nonfiction, fiction, and poetry, a clear picture of Austin, its history and its present realities and postures.","2007","2"

The plays and dramatists selected are representative of and have made considerable contributions to African American theater. Although the works of these playwrights span over sixty years, they are closely linked by the theme of women struggling to define their roles in society. The heroines speak out against interracial and intraracial biases, stereotyping, lynch mobs, illiteracy, poverty, promiscuity, self-righteousness, abusive men, rape, and miscegenation. Each play is preceded by a critical introduction that includes biographical information, an assessment of the playwright's contributions to black theater, and a synopsis and critical analysis of the play. The bibliography that follows the plays provides selected lists of published plays, produced plays, and anthologies. An index completes the work. This collection represents an effort to make available plays written by black women that have not been published or are now out of print. In recovering these plays, scholars will now be able to take a close look at the contributions that black women dramatists have made not only to African American theater, but to American theater in general.","1990","6"

"The Vietnam Reader: The Definitive Collection of American Fiction and Nonfiction on the War","Stewart O'Nan","9780385491181","The Vietnam Reader is a selection of the finest and best-known art from the American war in Vietnam, including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, drama, film, still photos, and popular song lyrics. All the strongest work is here, from mainstream bestsellers to radical poetry, from Tim O'Brien to Marvin Gaye. Also included are incisive reader's questionsuseful for educators and book clubsin a volume that makes an essential contribution to a wider understanding of the Vietnam War.This authoritative and accessible volume is sure to become a classic reference, as well as indispensable and provocative reading for anyone who wants to know more about the war that changed the face of late-twentieth-century America.Kirkus ReviewsO'Nan, himself the author of a well-received novel about the struggles of a Vietnam vet to readjust to civilian life (The Names of the Dead), has compiled a lengthy, varied, and somewhat idiosyncratic anthology of fiction and nonfiction by American writers about the war and its aftermath. The book was inspired, he notes in his preface, by his discovery that there was no wide-ranging compilation on the subject. O'Nan's selections, primarily excerpts from full-length works, include fiction by Tim O'Brien (Going After Cacciato, The Things They Carried), James Webb (Fields of Fire), Larry Heinemann (Paco's Story), Stephen Wright (Meditations in Green), and John Del Vecchio (The 13th Valley), plus excerpts from memoirs by Robert Mason (Chickenhawk), Ronald J. Glasser (365 Days), and Michael Lee Lanning (The Only War We Had). O'Nan also includes the lyrics of a variety of period songs ('The Ballad of the Green Berets,' 'Born in the USA'), critical summaries of films about the war, and some poetry. His adroit notes point out some of the most salient features of this literature (the relative neglect of the Vietnamese experience of war; the evolution of the American soldier protagonist from hero to cynical survivor; the persistent attempt to puzzle out what the war tells us about our society and government), and a glossary, bibliography, and chronology further help set the work in context. While the inclusion of more less-familiar writers would have been welcome, this is nonetheless a powerful, deeply revealing collection, and the best available introduction to a major body of modern American literature.","1998","8"

"Brother to Brother: New Writings by Black Gay Men","Essex Hemphill","9780978625115","The late black activist and poet Essex Hemphill follows in the footsteps of Joseph Beam with this powerful anthology of fiction, essays, and poetry by black gay men.Publishers WeeklyBelieving that the ``gay community . . . operates from a one-eyed, one gender, one colorstet without hyphens. sg perception of community ,'' Beam and Hemphill have compiled a volume of writings that addresspk the emerging black gay sensibility in all of its glory, pain and promise. The strength of the book's politics, however,pk is undermined by offerings of dubious literary merit.pk Generally, the short fiction is only adequately written, depicting young closeted men afraid to come out to their abusive parents and peers. One exception is John Keene Jr.'s ``Adelphus King,'' a sweet tale about a man who falls head over heels for his cousin's boyfriend, a charismatic jazz musician. The poems in the collection speak routinely about sex and love; the most touching deal with the loss of loved ones to AIDS. By far, the most satisfying writing is Ron Simmons's incisive ``Some thoughts on challenges facing black gay intellectuals,'' which exposes the homophobic views of many black writers and calls for the development of ``an affirming and liberating philosophical understanding of homosexuality that will self-actualize black gay genius.'' Hemphill is a poet; Beam, who edited In the Life , died in 1988. (June)","2007","4"
